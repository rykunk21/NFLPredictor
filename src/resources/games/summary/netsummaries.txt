Q1:
The Bears started the quarter with possession but stalled due to a combination of the Packers' stifling defense, led by P.Smith, and a costly penalty. After an initial decent runback, their drive lasted for six plays covering only 28 yards before giving up the ball on downs. The Packers then capitalized on their ensuing drive, covering 40 yards over 11 plays and ultimately reaching the end zone. While the Bears initially held them back with defensive plays by D.Walker and T.Stevenson, the Packers persisted, primarily relying on A.Jones and a few timely passes by J.Love. The Bears returned with a purposeful drive, moving 38 yards over 7 plays, with J.Fields making vital pass completions. Unfortunately, the drive ended with a field goal, bringing the score to CHI 3, GB 7. The Packers then went three-and-out, managing only 4 yards in their drive. The Bears got the ball back with T.Scott making a noteworthy return, but they too would be held to a field goal, rounding out the quarter at CHI 6, GB 7.

Q2:
The second quarter commenced with the Bears in possession and trying to advance from where they left off in Q1. J.Fields, displaying his dexterity, managed to cover ground both through the air and on foot. D.Foreman's efforts on the ground further propelled the Bears closer to scoring territory. Fields connected twice with D.Moore, including a 14-yard completion that got the Bears within striking distance of the end zone. However, the drive's momentum was hampered by a missed pass targeting C.Kmet and concluded with yet another field goal. The Packers then had a short, 3-play drive that failed to gain much ground. After a massive punt from D.Whelan, the Bears regained possession. Unfortunately for Chicago, they found themselves pinned back due to a penalty on B.Jones, and the drive stalled, requiring them to punt the ball away. The half ended with a narrow margin as the Packers led the Bears 7-6.

Q3:
The second half opened with the Green Bay Packers in possession, starting from their 25-yard line. They executed a meticulous 8-play drive that spanned 75 yards and culminated in a touchdown, taking the lead to 17-6. This drive was highlighted by a 51-yard pass from J.Love to A.Jones, setting the Packers up deep in the Bears' territory. On the Bears' ensuing possession, they had a woeful outing. Starting at their 25-yard line, J.Fields was immediately sacked for a loss of 11 yards. This set the tone for a disappointing series that ended with a punt after only three plays. The Packers capitalized on their good field position after the punt, starting on the Bears' 42-yard line. Despite a setback of a 2-yard loss on their first play, the Packers' offense continued to be productive. They scored another touchdown on a 35-yard pass play, although A.Jones was injured in the process. The Bears got the ball back and moved it with some efficiency, but their drive was prematurely ended by a fumble by J.Fields which was recovered by the Packers. However, the Packers couldn't capitalize on the turnover, ending their possession with a punt. The Bears, not to be outdone, put together a swift 6-play, 65-yard touchdown drive. The Bears executed a successful two-point conversion, ending the third quarter with a score of 24-14 in favor of the Packers.

Q4:
The fourth quarter began with the Packers in possession. Their offensive prowess remained evident as they combined both the ground and air game. This drive, starting from their own 39-yard line, culminated in a touchdown after a string of efficient plays, including an impressive 37-yard pass to L.Musgrave. This extended the Packers' lead to 31-14. The Bears looked to respond, starting from their own 25-yard line. However, misfortune struck as J.Fields threw an interception to Q.Walker, who returned it 37 yards for another Packers touchdown. A subsequent unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Packers seemed to have little impact on their momentum. The score now stood at a dominant 38-14 in favor of Green Bay. As the quarter continued, the Bears had another chance to respond. They began their drive from their 30-yard line, but after a series of plays, they were forced to punt once more. The provided information ends here, but it is evident that the Packers have dominated the Bears in both offense and defense in the second half.



Q1:
The game commenced with an unexpected move from the Las Vegas Raiders, as they executed an onside kick. However, this turned to their favor when a penalty was called against Denver’s T.Smith for an illegal touch. Capitalizing on the opportunity, the Raiders marched down the field. J.Jacobs played a role with a few runs, but it was J.Garoppolo’s pass to D.Adams that turned out to be significant, covering 13 yards and moving the chains on a crucial 4th down. Although they faced resistance, an Unnecessary Roughness penalty on Denver's J.Simmons aided the Raiders' efforts. The drive concluded with the Raiders punching in the first touchdown of the game. The Broncos responded in kind, commencing their drive with a solid return from M.Mims that was, unfortunately, tainted by a holding penalty. Despite this setback, R.Wilson demonstrated his passing prowess, connecting with B.Johnson for 21 yards and A.Trautman for another 15 yards, positioning the Broncos within striking distance. J.Williams provided balance to the offense with some noteworthy runs. This collective effort culminated in a Broncos touchdown, wrapping up the quarter with a score of 6-7 in favor of the Raiders.

Q2:
The Raiders kicked off the second quarter with an impressive drive. J.Garoppolo exhibited excellent chemistry with J.Meyers, connecting on a couple of impactful passes totaling 34 yards, pushing them deep into Broncos territory. However, the Broncos defense tightened their grip, holding the Raiders to a field goal. The ensuing Broncos drive began promisingly, especially when a Neutral Zone Infraction penalty on the Raiders provided a fresh set of downs. However, the Raiders' defense, led by standout plays from M.Crosby and D.Deablo, stifled the Broncos' momentum. This included a sack on R.Wilson and a play where J.McLaughlin lost 7 yards. The drive regressed, forcing the Broncos to punt. The Raiders' subsequent possession started deep in their own territory. J.Jacobs and D.Adams made minor contributions, but a Neutral Zone Infraction on Denver's F.Clark gifted the Raiders an automatic first down. Despite this, the drive details provided end here, indicating the Raiders had to punt at some point later in this drive. The half concluded with the Raiders leading the Broncos 10-6.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Denver Broncos initiating a decent drive down the field. Starting at their 26-yard line, courtesy of a 30-yard return by M. Mims, the Broncos made notable progress mainly on the ground with contributions from J. Williams and S. Perine. However, R. Wilson's pass game was inconsistent during the drive. The momentum was almost disrupted by R. Wilson's fumble, but a penalty on the Raiders turned the play into a no-game. After steadily making their way to the Raiders' 37, the Broncos attempted a 55-yard field goal which unfortunately went wide right, wasting their almost 5 and a half-minute drive.

The Raiders responded with a methodical offensive attack led by quarterback J. Garoppolo. While they primarily looked to J. Jacobs for their running game, Garoppolo sought to connect with D. Adams multiple times. The Raiders’ drive, which started at their 45, experienced some setbacks due to penalties but benefitted from a major defensive pass interference call on the Broncos. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't capitalize on the advantage, and their drive ended with an interception.

Q4:
In the fourth quarter, the Broncos began their drive near the end of the third quarter. Using a balanced attack of runs and short passes, they steadily advanced downfield. The highlight of the drive was R. Wilson's 20-yard pass to S. Perine. A roughing the kicker penalty on the Raiders during a punt attempt extended the Broncos' drive. Despite making it to the Raiders' 5-yard line, they were unable to punch it into the end zone. The Broncos settled for a field goal, taking the score to 16-10 in their favor.

The Raiders wasted no time on their subsequent drive. They covered 75 yards in just six plays, a drive heavily aided by penalties against the Broncos. Garoppolo made key completions, especially a significant 18-yarder to D. Adams. The drive was summarized in the provided details up until a timeout was called at 6:34 with the Raiders at the Broncos' 6-yard line. Based on the result mentioned, the Raiders managed to secure a touchdown, taking the lead 17-16.

The Broncos, hoping to regain the lead, had a rather underwhelming response. J. Williams lost a yard on the first play, and even though R. Wilson completed an 8-yard pass on third down, they found themselves punting after only three plays. The quarter's details end with the Broncos punting the ball to the Raiders, who presumably are looking to either extend their lead or run down the clock.




Q1:

The game between the Browns and Bengals began with Cincinnati receiving the kickoff. The Bengals initiated their drive on the CIN 35 after a 27-yard return.

The Browns' first possession started from their 14-yard line. Though D.Watson managed to scramble for a 12-yard gain, the drive was stifled by two sacks. The Browns then punted the ball away.

The Browns began their next drive from the 41-yard line. The highlight was a 17-yard run by N.Chubb, taking them to the Bengals' 26-yard line. However, a significant event took place as D.Watson fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the Bengals' C.Awuzie at the CIN 13.

Q2:

The second quarter began with the Browns in possession. Starting from their 43-yard line, they managed to move into scoring range, thanks to a 20-yard pass from D.Watson to A.Cooper. However, the drive stalled at the Bengals' 24-yard line, leading to a successful 42-yard field goal by D.Hopkins, giving the Browns a 3-0 lead.

Following the kickoff, the Bengals began from the CIN 17. The drive was hampered by an incomplete pass and a penalty for Delay of Game, forcing them to punt after gaining just 2 yards.

Details of the Browns' subsequent possession were cut off, but they started from their own 44-yard line. A promising 9-yard run by J.Ford was nullified by an Offensive Holding penalty against J.Bitonio. The summary ends at this point, with the Browns facing a 1st and 17 on their 37-yard line.

In summary, the first half was characterized by defensive dominance from both teams, with the Browns managing to secure a slight edge with a field goal.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Cleveland Browns possessing the ball but quickly punting after a short series. Cincinnati Bengals responded by advancing to the Browns' 24-yard line, largely helped by an 18-yard penalty against the Browns for Defensive Pass Interference. Though the drive didn't end in a touchdown, the Bengals managed to score their first points of the game via a 42-yard field goal from E. McPherson, making the score 10-3.

The Browns' next possession showcased a significant play where D. Watson completed a 33-yard pass to E. Moore, reaching the Bengals' territory. However, an interception by D. Hill halted their momentum, giving the Bengals another opportunity to close the score gap. Unfortunately for the Bengals, they could not capitalize. J. Burrow and his offense advanced to the Browns' 33-yard line but missed a 51-yard field goal attempt.

The Browns retaliated by engineering a fruitful drive starting from their 41-yard line, which ended with a 34-yard field goal from D. Hopkins. This extended the Browns' lead to 13-3.

As the quarter neared its conclusion, the Bengals began another drive. J. Burrow connected with J. Chase for a 10-yard gain, but the Bengals found themselves unable to convert a 3rd & 8, ending the quarter with a 4th & 5 situation on their 42-yard line.

Q4:
The final quarter opened with the Bengals punting the ball, giving possession back to the Browns. The Browns, starting at their 36-yard line, utilized a balanced approach between passes and runs. Notable plays included a 15-yard pass to D. Njoku and a 17-yard run by J. Ford. The drive concluded with D. Hopkins converting another field goal, this time from 43 yards, increasing the Browns' lead to 16-3.

In desperate need of points, the Bengals began their next drive. Despite the urgency, they struggled to make significant gains. After two incomplete passes by J. Burrow, he managed a 6-yard connection to I. Smith. However, the drive summary provided concludes with this play, suggesting the Bengals were unable to convert on the subsequent down.

With the Browns leading 16-3, and based on the play-by-play data given, their defense remained stout against the Bengals' offense, while their offense was effective enough to keep the scoreboard ticking in their favor.

Their drive culminated in a touchdown, giving them a lead of 24-20.

The Miami Dolphins responded with a drive of their own, starting at their 25-yard line. The Dolphins' offense showcased versatility with T. Tagovailoa's pass to T.

With both teams showcasing offensive firepower and defensive resilience, the game was poised for a thrilling conclusion.



Q1:
The game between the Detroit Lions and the Kansas City Chiefs commenced with H. Butker's touchback kickoff for the Chiefs. The Detroit Lions initiated with their offense but failed to gain significant yardage, ending their first drive with a punt after only three plays and 7 yards gained. The Kansas City Chiefs then took possession, moving the ball 25 yards over 6 plays. This effort was highlighted by P. Mahomes' 10-yard pass to J. McKinnon and his subsequent scramble for another 2 yards. However, they too ended up punting.

The Lions showcased a more structured offensive strategy on their third drive. Starting from their 9-yard line, the Lions displayed a combination of runs and passes. The highlight of this drive was a fake punt where J. Reeves-Maybin secured a first down on a 4th & 2 situation. This strategic move seemed to fuel the Lions as they marched down the field with J. Goff's successful passes to A. St. Brown and J. Reynolds. D. Montgomery also contributed with some solid runs. Ultimately, the Lions capped off this 91-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass from J. Goff to A. St. Brown. Following a successful extra point, the Lions led 7-0.

St. Brown, and S. LaPorta, pushing the team into Chiefs' territory. D. Montgomery consistently contributed short gains on the ground. However, disaster struck for the Lions when they reached the Chiefs' 17-yard line. On a muffed snap, they lost some yards, but J. Goff managed to recover the ball. Yet, on the next 3rd & 10 play, M. Jones fumbled after a short pass reception, and the Chiefs' B. Cook managed to recover the ball on the KC 7-yard line.

With the momentum seemingly shifting, the Chiefs started their next drive deep in their territory. They were limited in their progress, only gaining 5 yards in 3 plays. P. Mahomes tried to maneuver through the Lions' defense but found limited success, forcing the Chiefs to punt.


Q3:
The third quarter began with the Kansas City Chiefs (KC) in possession, but they were forced to punt after a short drive of only 14 yards in 5 plays. During this drive, the Chiefs' I.Pacheco was injured after a 10-yard completion from P.Mahomes. The Detroit Lions (DET) took over but had a brief drive of their own, advancing only 4 yards in 3 plays before punting the ball back to the Chiefs.

The Chiefs' next drive was catastrophic. On the third play, P.Mahomes threw an interception to B.Branch, who returned it for a 50-yard touchdown, tying the game at 14-14.

They managed to travel 73 yards in 8 plays, with notable actions such as a 41-yard penalty on DET's C.Sutton for Defensive Pass Interference. However, unable to convert a 3rd down in the red zone, the Chiefs settled for a 35-yard field goal, taking the lead 17-14.

Q4:
The fourth quarter started with the Chiefs in possession on their 32-yard line. They managed a promising drive, spearheaded by a 24-yard pass from P.Mahomes to N.Gray, taking them deep into Detroit territory. The Chiefs progressed steadily down the field, with notable plays such as a 7-yard pass to C.Edwards-Helaire and a 9-yard scramble by P.Mahomes. The drive summary provided only goes up to the Chiefs being on the Lions' 20-yard line with a 2nd & 1 situation, but it's mentioned that the drive resulted in a field goal, extending the Chiefs' lead to 20-14.

The Lions then took control of the ball, making a brief push down the field. After gaining 21 yards in 5 plays, the Lions faced a 4th & 2 situation on the Chiefs' 45-yard line. A critical incompletion by J.Goff on 4th down turned over the ball to the Chiefs.

Kansas City had another opportunity to regain the lead, but their effort was stifled. Starting from their own 45-yard line, a promising 17-yard pass to S.Moore was nullified due to an offensive holding penalty. The Chiefs' situation deteriorated, facing a 4th & 25 situation from their own 30-yard line after a series of unsuccessful plays. P.Mahomes' deep pass intended for Ju.Watson was incomplete, effectively ending their scoring hopes.

Q1:
The first quarter of the game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars saw both teams struggling to establish dominance. The quarter began with a touchback kick by B.McManus for the Jaguars. The Colts opened with a rather unproductive drive, which consisted of three plays, covering no distance and culminating in a punt. A.Richardson, the Colts' quarterback, attempted three plays, including a short pass to J.Downs and an incomplete pass. On the third play, he was sacked by J.Allen for a loss of 2 yards. The Jaguars received the ball but mirrored the Colts' lack of progress, managing only three plays themselves. Their young quarterback, T.Lawrence, delivered an incomplete pass, a short pass to E.Engram, and another incomplete pass, forcing the Jaguars to punt. The Colts' subsequent possession was similarly uneventful, with another three-play drive that ended in a punt. However, the Jaguars managed to break the pattern with a dynamic nine-play, 61-yard drive that culminated in a touchdown by C.Ridley. With momentum seemingly on their side, the Colts responded impressively, orchestrating an 11-play, 75-yard drive that also concluded with a touchdown, courtesy of D.Jackson's consistent efforts and A.Richardson's accurate passes.

Q2:
As the second quarter started, both teams seemed to find their rhythm. The Jaguars began their drive with T.Etienne making an 8-yard run. However, after a successful pass from T.Lawrence to C.Ridley that covered 14 yards, chaos ensued as Ridley fumbled the ball, resulting in injuries to two Colts players, K.Moore and D.Flowers. But a subsequent interception by the Colts' T.Brown, who returned the ball 34 yards to the Jaguars' 25-yard line, shifted the momentum back to the Colts. Capitalizing on this opportunity, the Colts managed to push to the Jaguars' 16-yard line. However, their offensive drive was thwarted just yards away from the end zone, resulting in a turnover on downs. The Jaguars, pinned deep in their territory, attempted to make headway with three running plays by T.Bigsby but to no avail. The quarter's summary ends with the Jaguars gearing up for a punt after a failed run by T.Bigsby that lost 2 yards.

Q3:

The third quarter kicked off with the Jaguars in possession, but they failed to capitalize on the drive as they quickly went three-and-out after an unsuccessful series that led to a punt. The Colts, on the other hand, demonstrated aggressive playcalling, using a no-huddle offense to their advantage. Their six-play drive was highlighted by a 39-yard touchdown pass from A. Richardson to M. Pittman, tying the score at 14-all.

The Jaguars responded with a methodical drive that included a 26-yard pass completion to E. Engram, but they had to settle for a field goal, taking a 3-point lead. Following this, the Colts’ offense was stifled by the Jaguars' defense, particularly J. Allen who sacked A. Richardson twice. The Colts were forced to punt.

The Jaguars attempted to extend their lead, but their drive ended abruptly as they turned the ball over on downs after an unsuccessful pass on a crucial 4th & 1 situation. The Colts took over but quickly fumbled the ball two plays later, handing possession back to Jacksonville. In a stunning twist, the Jaguars' subsequent play resulted in a fumble return touchdown by DeForest Buckner for the Colts, giving them a 21-17 lead.

Jacksonville tried to regain momentum, but their efforts were in vain. After a short three-and-out series, they had to punt the ball back to the Colts. The quarter wrapped up with the Colts on a fresh drive, but a holding penalty nullified a significant 16-yard run, setting them back 10 yards.


Q4:
In the fourth quarter, the Colts struggled to find consistency, while the Jaguars displayed resilience, eventually overcoming a deficit to seize the game. The quarter began with the Colts punting the ball after an unsuccessful drive, giving the Jaguars a chance to shine.

The Jaguars, starting from their 43-yard line, advanced towards the Colts' territory. Despite making some yardage with the help of players like T.Etienne and T.Bigsby, they found themselves halted at the Colts' 48-yard line due to a solid defensive stance by Z.Franklin.

Upon regaining possession, the Colts once again faltered. Their offensive attempts were primarily thwarted, and they ended up punting again. However, a brilliant 48-yard return by J.Agnew placed the Jaguars in an advantageous position at the Colts' 46.

Seizing the moment, the Jaguars embarked on a drive that would witness their quarterback, T.Lawrence, effectively maneuvering through the Colts' defense. Through a combination of short passes and rushes, they reached the Colts' end zone, culminating in a 26-yard touchdown rush by T.Etienne. This move brought the score to JAX 24, IND 21.

The Colts, now trailing, attempted to rally back. However, their efforts were curtailed as A.Richardson's pass intended for M.Alie-Cox was intercepted by Ty.Campbell. The Jaguars wasted no time capitalizing on this turnover. A few efficient plays later, T.Etienne dazzled again with a 26-yard touchdown run, solidifying Jacksonville's lead.

Hoping for a late-game comeback, the Colts initiated a lengthy drive. A.Richardson targeted M.Pittman multiple times, successfully advancing deep into the Jaguars' territory. Yet, as the clock ticked away, the Colts found themselves just short of the end zone. In a decisive moment, G.Minshew's pass to M.Pittman on the JAX 1-yard line was incomplete, resulting in a turnover on downs.

With mere seconds left, T.Lawrence executed a couple of plays to wind down the clock. The game concluded with the Jaguars triumphing over the Colts, 31-21.
Q1:
The game started with a kickoff by the Cardinals' M.Prater, giving the Washington Commanders the first possession. The Commanders managed to gain 26 yards over 8 plays but eventually had to punt after not being able to convert on third down. Notably, a penalty against the Commanders on the punt meant they lost some ground. The Cardinals' first possession was not any more fruitful. Starting from their own 17-yard line, they only managed 13 yards in 6 plays. A notable play from this drive was J.Dobbs' pass to Z.Ertz, which gained 6 yards and secured a first down. The Cardinals too had to punt. On the Commanders' second possession, the momentum shifted. Despite starting deep in their own territory, they managed a touchdown in a 91-yard, 6-play drive, bringing the score to 7-0. Crucial penalties against the Cardinals and a successful pass interference call against the Cardinals helped them considerably. The Cardinals, eager to respond, managed a field goal on their subsequent drive, which was spearheaded by a 29-yard run by M.Brown and a 31-yard pass to R.Moore. The quarter concluded with a 7-3 score favoring the Commanders.

Q2:
The second quarter started with the Commanders in possession, but it quickly turned in favor of the Cardinals when S.Howell's pass intended for J.Dotson was intercepted by Z.Collins. This was due to the pressure exerted by K.Strong. Despite starting in a strong field position following the interception, the Cardinals couldn't capitalize with a touchdown. Instead, they had to settle for a 54-yard field goal by M.Prater, making the score 7-6. When the Commanders got the ball back, they seemed determined to extend their lead. With efficient running by B.Robinson, they managed to move the ball 59 yards in 8 plays. However, the drive concluded with a fumble, leaving the game's momentum up for grabs.

Throughout the first half, both teams showed moments of brilliance but also displayed vulnerabilities. Penalties played a significant role, often changing the course of drives. The narrow 7-6 lead for the Commanders set the stage for an engaging second half.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Arizona Cardinals already in possession and trailing by a narrow margin. The Cardinals launched a systematic offensive approach that took almost 5 minutes off the clock. Over 11 plays, they moved 56 yards down the field. The drive was punctuated by a series of consistent passes by J. Dobbs, connecting with receivers such as M. Brown, Mi. Wilson, and Z. Ertz. The Cardinals' momentum was somewhat stalled near the red zone, and they had to settle for a 37-yard field goal by M. Prater, putting them ahead 16-10.

In contrast, the Washington Commanders' offense struggled to make a dent. Their first possession of the half resulted in a punt after seven plays yielded zero net yards. Howell, the Commanders' quarterback, was notably sacked, pushing the team into an unfavorable position.

The Cardinals' next possession was similarly stifled, ending in a punt after only four plays. Washington's defensive unit seemed to tighten up, evidenced by D. Payne's fumble recovery after M. Sweat's sack on J. Dobbs, giving the Commanders a prime scoring opportunity as the quarter drew to a close.

Q4:
The fourth quarter started with the Commanders capitalizing on their late third-quarter opportunity. Positioned on the Cardinals' 29-yard line, they mainly relied on their running back, B. Robinson, who consistently chewed up yardage with multiple runs. This ground-and-pound strategy was fruitful, culminating in a touchdown and allowing the Commanders to retake the lead 17-16.

As the quarter progressed, the Cardinals' offense once again failed to gain significant traction. Their first possession of the quarter saw them going backward rather than forward, resulting in a quick three-and-out, forcing them to punt the ball away.

When the Commanders regained possession, they aimed to build on their slender lead. However, their drive didn't last long either. B. Robinson had a mix of positive and negative rushes, and S. Howell's passing didn't yield the necessary first downs. Ultimately, the Commanders also had to punt, but they managed to chew up some crucial time off the clock.

The details provided end at this point, but it's evident that both teams were in a tight contest, with defenses stepping up and offenses struggling to maintain consistent momentum. The Commanders, after trailing for a significant part of the game, managed to come back into the lead in the final quarter.




Q1:
In the opening quarter, the Atlanta Falcons started with the ball but failed to gain any traction, resulting in a punt after quarterback D.Ridder suffered a sack that resulted in a fumble which he recovered. The Carolina Panthers then had a long drive, progressively advancing toward the Falcon's end zone. After a series of positive gains and moving the chains, their drive was thwarted on the Falcon's 11-yard line when C.Hubbard was stopped short of the first down. The Falcons then had possession and showed promise with back-to-back runs by T.Allgeier, gaining significant yardage. However, Carolina's defense, particularly B.Burns, stepped up to sack D.Ridder and halt the drive. The Panthers then had a disastrous drive marked by penalties and a critical interception by J.Bates.

The quarter concluded with the Falcons capitalizing on the turnover. After a couple of short gains, D.Ridder connected with B.Robinson for an 11-yard touchdown, which was the highlight of the quarter.

Q2:
Starting the second quarter with a 7-point lead, the Falcons kicked off to the Panthers. Carolina's ensuing drive was short-lived, as their three plays resulted in a punt after several incomplete passes. The Falcons regained possession but found themselves penalized for an illegal shift. Despite a successful pass by D.Ridder, the play was nullified, leading to another Falcons' punt.

The Panthers, not to be outdone, orchestrated a balanced drive combining runs from M.Sanders and precise passing by B.Young. The drive culminated in a touchdown, leveling the scores at 7 apiece. The Panthers displayed resilience, chipping away at the Falcons' defense play by play, using a mix of rushes and passes to cover the 75 yards in 12 plays.

In summary, while the Falcons displayed initial dominance in the first quarter, the Panthers clawed their way back in the second quarter to even the score. Critical moments included J.Bates' interception for the Falcons and B.Young's persistent passing for the Panthers, ensuring both teams went into halftime with everything to play for.

Q3:
Starting the second half, the Carolina Panthers led the drive from their own 25-yard line, managing to push into Falcons' territory. Throughout their nine-play drive, the Panthers advanced 50 yards in a span of 4:14. They relied on a balanced attack, with QB B.Young making short passes to G.Ricci, H.Hurst, and J.Mingo and utilizing their running game with C.Hubbard and M.Sanders contributing significantly. Sanders had a crucial 10-yard run that brought them close to the Falcons' end zone. However, unable to secure a touchdown, the Panthers settled for a 43-yard field goal by E.Pineiro, extending their lead to 10-7.

In response, the Falcons' offense struggled, being limited to just a three-play drive covering a mere seven yards before having to punt. D.Ridder tried connecting with K.Pitts but couldn't find success, and their short running game didn't yield much either. Their drive consumed only 1:12 of the quarter.

The Panthers, looking to increase their lead, embarked on a five-play drive covering 19 yards. B.Young led the team down the field with short passes and runs by M.Sanders and C.Hubbard. However, disaster struck for the Panthers as B.Young's pass intended for T.Marshall was intercepted by J.Bates. The situation for the Panthers worsened due to a penalty for Unnecessary Roughness on I.Thomas.

Capitalizing on the turnover, the Falcons started with great field position and made rapid progress. After a mix of successful runs and passes, they managed to cover 61 yards in just seven plays. The drive highlighted strong performances from T.Allgeier and B.Robinson, moving them into scoring position by the end of the third quarter.

Q4:
In the fourth quarter, the Carolina Panthers began with possession, ending their 18th drive with a punt after achieving only 4 yards across 6 plays. The subsequent two drives, one each by the Atlanta Falcons and the Panthers, resulted in punts, with neither team making significant progress. However, momentum shifted when the Falcons regained possession for their 21st drive. They marched down the field 56 yards in 6 plays, culminating in a touchdown that widened the score gap to 24-10 in their favor. The following drives saw both teams' defenses come alive. The Panthers had two more possessions but failed to capitalize, with the final attempt turning the ball over on downs after a 40-yard drive in 12 plays. The Falcons, meanwhile, played conservatively, punting in their 23rd drive and using their 25th drive to run down the clock. The quarter concluded with the Falcons' D.Ridder kneeling to end the game, solidifying their win with a final score of 24-10.


Q1:
The game started with the New York Giants making a robust drive down the field, covering 48 yards in 11 plays. Despite their steady progression, the drive ended with a blocked field goal that was returned 58 yards for a touchdown by the Cowboys. This unfortunate turn of events meant that instead of potentially leading the game, the Giants found themselves down 0-6. Following this, the Giants' subsequent drive was ineffective, resulting in a punt after three incomplete plays. The Cowboys then took over and made significant progress with a 49-yard pass to C.Lamb being the highlight. However, the Giants' defense held the Cowboys to a field goal, extending the Dallas lead to 9-0. The quarter continued to be unfavorable for the Giants. On their next possession, a sack and subsequent interception returned for a touchdown by D.Bland of the Cowboys further widened the gap, making the score 16-0 in favor of Dallas. A subsequent short drive by the Giants culminated in another punt. The Cowboys started another drive, but as the first quarter concluded, they hadn't scored on it.

Q2:
The second quarter began with the Cowboys still in possession. Their drive from the end of Q1 culminated in a 38-yard field goal, extending their lead to 19-0. The Giants' offensive woes persisted. On their next possession, quarterback D.Jones threw another interception, this time caught by S.Gilmore of the Cowboys, effectively ending their drive before it could truly begin. As the provided summary ends here, we are left in suspense regarding the outcome of the game. However, throughout the first half, the Giants' offense faced substantial challenges, resulting in multiple turnovers and a failure to put points on the board. The Cowboys, on the other hand, capitalized on these opportunities, earning a dominant lead by mid-game.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Dallas Cowboys continuing their dominance, orchestrating a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that took nearly 5 minutes. The drive featured a blend of rushing and passing, with notable plays being a 10-yard pass from D.Prescott to M.Gallup, a 25-yard rush by T.Pollard to the NYG 23, and a fumble recovery by DAL-T.Biadasz at the NYG 4, preserving their possession and eventual score.

The Giants, in contrast, struggled mightily. Their subsequent drive lasted 7 plays and saw them advance only 7 yards before having to punt. Key moments from this drive included a fumble by D.Jones, which he managed to recover, and a sack on D.Jones for a loss of 4 yards.

The Cowboys' next drive was relatively short-lived, amassing only 8 yards in 4 plays before punting. A notable play was a penalty on NYG's T.Hawkins for defensive holding.

The Giants' ensuing possession was again marked by challenges. Although it started promisingly with an 18-yard run by S.Barkley, the drive stalled. They managed to reach midfield but couldn't convert on a 4th down, turning over on downs as the quarter came to a close.

Q4:
The Cowboys opened the fourth quarter in command, covering 50 yards in 8 plays and sealing another touchdown. The drive showcased Prescott's effective passing, notably connecting with C.Lamb for a 19-yard gain and relying on T.Pollard's rushes, including a 12-yard advance to the NYG 19.

However, the Giants' miseries persisted. In their next possession, starting at their own 25-yard line, D.Jones connected with I.Hodgins for a 24-yard pass, but the latter fumbled the ball, which was recovered by DAL's I.Mukuamu at the DAL 40.

Dallas's subsequent drive was short and uneventful, spanning only 3 plays for a mere 2-yard gain before opting to punt. Backup quarterback #10-C.Rush came in for Dallas, signaling a shift in strategy with their significant lead.

The final detailed drive for the Giants was again a picture of their struggles throughout the game. Over 10 plays, they could only muster 19 yards, culminating in another turnover on downs.

Throughout the second half, the Giants struggled to find rhythm or momentum, while the Cowboys consistently capitalized on their opportunities and maintained their dominance. The difference in performance between the two teams was starkly evident, with the Cowboys appearing clinical and efficient, and the Giants displaying a lack of cohesion and making critical errors.


Q1:
The game began with a Buffalo Bills possession that lasted for a short five plays and 17 yards, ultimately ending in a punt. Key players for the Bills in this drive included J. Allen, S. Diggs, D. Harty, and J. Cook. The New York Jets responded with a drive of their own, spanning five plays and 34 yards. This drive saw a significant 26-yard gain by Bre. Hall, but a major event occurred when A. Rodgers was sacked and injured, forcing Z. Wilson to take over as the Jets' quarterback. Despite a promising 22-yard reception by A. Lazard, the Jets' drive also ended in a punt.

The Bills then began a more promising drive, starting with a penalty against them, but eventually managed to gain 55 yards over 11 plays. J. Allen's scrambling ability and his connection with players like D. Harty and D. Knox became apparent. The drive culminated in a 40-yard field goal by T. Bass, making the score 3-0 in favor of Buffalo. The Jets' final drive of the quarter began promisingly, especially with a 22-yard pass to A. Lazard, but it soon faltered with penalties and a sack on Z. Wilson, forcing them to punt and ending the first quarter.

Q2:
Starting the second quarter, the Bills had possession but after three plays, J. Allen threw an interception to J. Whitehead of the Jets, with no gain on the return. The Jets capitalized on this turnover with a massive 83-yard run by Bre. Hall, placing them in a favorable position. However, their drive stalled close to the end zone and they had to settle for a 26-yard field goal by G. Zuerlein, tying the game at 3-3.

Subsequently, the Bills showcased their offensive prowess with an 11-play, 75-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Key moments included an 18-yard pass to S. Diggs, and J. Allen's proficiency both in the air and on the ground was evident. Though the Bills faced setbacks, such as a 5-yard loss by J.

The third quarter opened with the New York Jets behind by a score, holding at 6-13 in favor of the Buffalo Bills. In their first drive, the Jets showcased a determined offense, moving 50 yards in 12 plays. Notably, Z.Wilson connected with G.Wilson for a 12-yard completion and later, with Bre.Hall for a 20-yard advance. The promising drive met a stumbling block as Bre.Hall fumbled, though the ball luckily went out of bounds at BUF 25. The drive concluded with G.Zuerlein successfully converting a 43-yard field goal.

Buffalo then took possession, looking to extend their lead. J.Allen made productive short passes, such as a 15-yard connection to D.Knox and an 8-yard toss to S.Diggs. However, the drive came to an abrupt end when a deep pass intended for S.Diggs was intercepted by J.Whitehead at NYJ -1, marking a touchback.

After the interception, the Jets started another offensive, but after just four plays, they were forced to punt. Similarly, the Bills, with only three plays in their drive, found themselves punting as well, ending the third quarter.

The Bills, looking to maintain their lead, suffered another setback. J.Allen's short right pass intended for G.Davis was intercepted by J.Whitehead at the NYJ 43.

Capitalizing on the turnover, the Jets pushed forward with determination. Z.Wilson made a pivotal 24-yard connection with A.Lazard to reach the BUF 28. Continuous efforts, including plays from D.Cook and Bre.Hall, took them closer to the end zone. The summary ended on a cliffhanger at the BUF 23, but it's evident that the Jets, tying the game at 13-13, managed to find the end zone in this drive, setting the stage for a thrilling conclusion.
Q1:
The Philadelphia Eagles opened the game with an impressive 61-yard drive that lasted for more than 7 minutes. Notably, K.Gainwell was frequently used, both in the running and passing game, showcasing his versatility. The drive faced a minor hiccup when J.Hurts fumbled, but the play was negated by a penalty on the Patriots' D.Wise for Defensive Offside. After 14 plays, the Eagles settled for a field goal, putting the first points on the board.

The Patriots' response was not as they would have hoped. Starting from their own 24, they moved the ball methodically towards the Eagles' territory. Just when they were closing in, M.Jones threw a costly interception to D.Slay, who returned it 70 yards for a touchdown. The quarter only worsened for the Patriots when, on their next possession, M.Jones connected with E.Elliott, who fumbled the ball on the same play, leading to another Eagles' recovery. Seizing the opportunity, the Eagles efficiently covered the short field in just four plays, capitalizing with another touchdown to take a 16-0 lead. By the end of the quarter, both teams exchanged punts, indicating some stabilization in the Patriots' defense.

Q2:
The second quarter commenced with the Eagles in possession, but they were forced to punt after a short three-and-out series. When the Patriots took over, their offensive struggles continued. M.Jones and his team managed to gain just a meager 3 yards in three plays. The Eagles, too, mirrored the Patriots' struggles on their next drive, accumulating only 3 yards before punting the ball away. On the Patriots' subsequent drive, despite starting from a promising position on their own 43, they failed to make significant progress. E.Elliott's rush was thwarted for a loss, and though M.Jones connected with K.Bourne for some yardage, it was not enough to reignite the Patriots' offense. The details provided cut off at this point, but by the middle of the second quarter, the Eagles remained dominantly ahead with a 16-0 lead.

Q3:
The third quarter commenced with the New England Patriots trailing the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 14-16. The quarter began with a Patriots' drive that was stymied by the Eagles' solid defense, forcing a punt after a mere three plays. The ball swiftly changed hands, with the Eagles then taking control. Under the guidance of QB J.Hurts, the Eagles made steady progress, notably through short passes to receivers A.Brown, D.Smith, and K.Gainwell, and Hurts' own scrambling ability. However, a penalty against the Eagles and two incomplete passes hampered their momentum. Nevertheless, they managed to get within range for J.Elliott to successfully convert a 56-yard field goal, extending their lead to 19-14.

The Patriots responded with a drive of their own, showing promise as M.Jones connected with J.Smith-Schuster and K.Bourne for notable gains. However, the Patriots' advance was marred by penalties, and despite reaching the Eagles' territory, they were forced to punt.

Closing out the third quarter, the Eagles launched another promising drive from their 20-yard line. With J.Hurts once again orchestrating, the Eagles leveraged short gains and a key 13-yard reception by D.Smith to move into the Patriots' territory. The quarter ended with the Eagles on the move, situated on the Patriots' 46-yard line.

Q4:
The fourth quarter saw both teams delivering dramatic performances with the game on the line. Philadelphia's J. Hurts maintained a consistent attack with a series of completions, primarily to A. Brown. However, New England's defense was able to make crucial stops, keeping the Eagles to two field goals, one of which bounced in off the right upright. The Patriots responded with urgency. Despite a failed two-point conversion after a 11-yard touchdown pass from M. Jones to K. Bourne, New England kept it tight, trailing by just 5 points. A dramatic moment occurred when J. Hurts, on a drive after the Patriots' touchdown, fumbled the ball, giving New England a golden opportunity. Yet, the Eagles' defense rose to the occasion. Despite a few successful plays, M. Jones faced relentless pressure from the Eagles, resulting in multiple incomplete passes and a crucial sack. The Eagles, however, couldn't capitalize on the subsequent drive, and a key incomplete pass on a 4th & 2 gave New England one last chance. In a final, nail-biting drive, M. Jones showcased his prowess, moving the Patriots down the field with completions to key receivers like K. Bourne and M. Gesicki. However, with time running out, the Patriots couldn't get past the Eagles' defense, ending the game with Philadelphia ahead 25-20.




Q1:

The game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Houston Texans commenced with the Ravens receiving the kick-off. The first drive by the Ravens was unproductive, which saw L. Jackson get sacked by J. Greenard and end up punting the ball. The Texans then took over but struggled to progress as well, with C. Stroud being sacked by P. Queen. However, a critical penalty on the Ravens gave the Texans another shot, which they squandered, leading to a punt.

The Ravens' third drive displayed some promise, with L. Jackson making considerable gains and Z. Flowers also playing a crucial role. However, the promising drive ended in disappointment when L. Jackson's pass intended for Z. Flowers was intercepted by S. Nelson. Houston's next possession was similarly unproductive as they faced penalties and could only gain a minimal yardage before punting.

The Ravens then took over and masterfully executed a scoring drive, highlighted by a deep pass from L. Jackson to Z. Flowers that got them close to the end zone. This drive concluded with a touchdown, putting the Ravens ahead 7-0. However, the Texans were unable to respond effectively on their subsequent possession, marking the end of the first quarter.

Q2:

The second quarter saw the Ravens starting off with the ball. While they made some gains, a penalty against S. Nelson for Defensive Pass Interference was the most significant event in the early part of the drive. However, a series of further penalties against the Ravens, including an Illegal Use of Hands by R. Stanley and Intentional Grounding by L. Jackson, stunted their progress. The drive ended with them punting the ball.

The Texans then showcased a long and well-orchestrated drive, managing to progress considerably down the field over 15 plays. Although details for the entire drive aren't provided, it culminated in a field goal, allowing the Texans to put some points on the board, making the score 7-3 in favor of the Ravens.

To conclude, the first half saw a dominant performance from the Ravens, but the Texans displayed resilience towards the end of Q2, hinting at a potentially competitive second half.

Q3:

The third quarter started with the Houston Texans at a disadvantage with a score of 7-6 in favor of the Baltimore Ravens. The Texans began the half poorly, failing to make any substantial progress and punting after three unsuccessful plays. In contrast, the Ravens displayed dominance, quickly capitalizing on their possession with a 71-yard drive that ended in a touchdown, increasing their lead to 15-6. The Ravens' key player, L. Jackson, played a significant role in this success with a deep pass to Z. Flowers and another short pass to R. Bateman that significantly advanced their position.

Houston's following drive seemed promising, initially gaining 17 yards. However, despite their efforts and moving towards the Ravens' territory, the Texans were halted on the fourth down, unable to convert the needed yard for a first down. Baltimore quickly retaliated, and although they faced a few setbacks, they managed to score another touchdown, pushing their lead further to 22-6. Houston's defensive challenges continued as they could not stop the Ravens' drive, which was highlighted by a significant 13-yard gain by G. Edwards.

A twist came towards the end of the third quarter when L. Jackson, during the Ravens' drive, fumbled the ball due to a sack, allowing the Texans to recover it in a good field position. The Texans took advantage of this opportunity, making steady progress, and as the quarter came to a close, they were nearing the Ravens' end zone. The quarter concluded with the Texans in a promising position but still trailing 22-6.

L.Jackson showcased his passing skills with a notable 17-yard pass to Z.Flowers but was subsequently sacked twice.

The Houston Texans' Drive19 began with promise, especially with a 26-yard pass completion to N.Collins. However, it was cut short when C.Stroud was sacked and fumbled the ball, leading to a recovery by the Ravens.

Drive20 for the Ravens was more fruitful. After a series of plays, L.Jackson connected with O.Beckham for a significant 29-yard gain. The drive culminated in a field goal, increasing the Ravens' lead to 25-9.

The Texans attempted to rally in Drive21, with C.Stroud showcasing his versatility by both passing and scrambling. However, the drive concluded with an incomplete pass on a crucial 4th and 13. The Ravens, in their subsequent possession (Drive22), played it safe, running the ball thrice before punting it away.

In the last minute, the Texans tried to salvage some points with their final drive of the game (Drive23). C.Stroud made a series of short passes, moving the ball progressively up the field. However, as the clock ticked down, they couldn't capitalize on their final plays, and the game concluded with the Ravens leading 25-9.






Q1:

The game kicked off with the Tennessee Titans' N.Folk launching a 63-yard kick, which was returned by the New Orleans Saints' R.Shaheed to the NO 21. However, an unfortunate fumble caused by A.Hooker was challenged by the Titans, leading to them gaining possession at the NO 24. Despite a good position, the Titans struggled with penalties and incomplete passes, finally settling for a 50-yard field goal by N.Folk, putting the score at TEN 3, NO 0.

The Saints responded with a spirited drive starting with a return to the NO 25. Quarterback D.Carr showcased his prowess with deep and short passes, especially to M.Thomas. They advanced impressively, with Carr connecting with R.Shaheed for a significant 22-yard gain. However, they couldn't cross into the end zone and settled for a 26-yard field goal, tying the game at 3-3.

The Titans were back with a strong drive initiated from the TEN 25. The focal point of this drive was the synergy between R.Tannehill and D.Henry. Henry showcased his running abilities with consistent gains, while Tannehill had a good connection with D.Hopkins. Yet, they couldn't breach the Saints' red zone defense, wrapping up their possession with another field goal from N.Folk, inching ahead 6-3.

The first quarter closed with the Saints having a brief drive, marred by penalties and short gains. They had to punt from the NO 26, handing the ball back to the Titans. The Titans couldn't capitalize either, with their short drive concluding with a punt from the TEN 25.

Q2:

The second quarter began with the Saints on their own 13-yard line. A couple of notable plays included a 17-yard pass from D.Carr to C.Olave and a 6-yard run by J.Williams. However, the Titans' defense held strong, especially with A.Key's sack on D.Carr. Following an injury to the Titans' K.Fulton, the Saints decided to punt from the NO 36.

The next possession for the Titans started at the TEN 23. The Titans leaned on their star running back, D.Henry, but he could only gain a few yards. The drive was short and resulted in another punt, leaving the score unchanged at TEN 6, NO 3.

The play-by-play stops here, but throughout the first half, both teams showcased sturdy defenses, leading to a low-scoring game dominated by field goals. Both teams had opportunities but couldn't capitalize fully, making turnovers and penalties crucial in the first half.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Tennessee Titans in possession, starting from their 25-yard line. After a few successful plays, quarterback R.Tannehill attempted a deep pass to C.Moore, which was intercepted by M.Maye at the Saints' 1-yard line.

Capitalizing on this turnover, the New Orleans Saints embarked on a promising drive, covering 60 yards in 7 plays. The highlight of this drive was a remarkable 45-yard pass from D.Carr to C.Olave, setting them up in Titans territory. However, the drive ended with B.Grupe successfully converting a 52-yard field goal to tie the game at 9-9.

Tennessee's next possession was short-lived. After gaining just 9 yards in 4 plays, the Titans were forced to punt. The Saints' return was initially strong, with R.Shaheed returning the punt for 23 yards, but a holding penalty set them back 10 yards.

New Orleans then began their drive from their own 18-yard line but could only muster 26 yards in 5 plays. After a failed third-down conversion, they had to punt the ball back to the Titans.

Tennessee's subsequent drive was once again thwarted by an interception. After making a modest progression to their 16-yard line in 3 plays, R.Tannehill's pass intended for D.Hopkins was intercepted by P.Adebo at the Titans' 33.

New Orleans took full advantage of this second interception, covering 33 yards in 5 plays to score a touchdown. The highlight was D.Carr's 19-yard touchdown pass to R.Shaheed. With B.Grupe's extra point, the Saints took the lead at 16-9.

Ending the quarter, Tennessee initiated another drive, making their way to the NO 33-yard line with a series of passes and runs. The game went into the fourth quarter with the Titans looking to respond to the Saints' lead.

Q4:
The fourth quarter between the Saints and the Titans was a gripping sequence of events, witnessing two teams relentlessly vying for the win.

The Titans started the quarter with a promising drive. Tannehill, showcasing impeccable precision, connected with D.Hopkins on multiple occasions, advancing the ball deep into Saints territory. Although the Titans displayed resilience, a few incomplete passes, and the Saints' steadfast defense led them to settle for a 45-yard field goal by N.Folk, inching the score to 16-12.

In response, the Saints initiated their drive with determination. Quarterback D.Carr orchestrated a series of plays, most notably linking up with C.Olave for significant gains on two occasions. Yet, a false start penalty and staunch defense by the Titans ensured that the drive culminated in a punt, without adding any points to the Saints' tally.

Seizing the momentum, the Titans once again took the field. Tannehill was in his element, demonstrating strong coordination with N.Westbrook-Ikhine, enabling the team to make big plays. Despite a couple of penalties against the Saints and the Titans advancing perilously close to the end zone, the Saints defense held firm. This forced the Titans to once again rely on N.Folk, who successfully converted a 29-yard field goal, narrowing the score difference to a mere point with the Saints at 16 and the Titans at 15.

With the game on a knife's edge, the Saints embarked on what would be the last drive of the match. After a penalty and a couple of minor gains, D.Carr delivered a remarkable pass to R.Shaheed, who sprinted out of bounds at the Titans' 26, after a 41-yard gain. This play was even reviewed for its validity, but the decision on the field stood. As the clock dwindled, J.Williams had a significant 11-yard rush that placed the Saints on the Titans' 9-yard line. In a heart-stopping turn of events, Williams fumbled the ball but managed to recover it himself, keeping the Saints' hopes alive. However, time was not on their side. As the seconds ticked away, the game concluded with the Saints narrowly holding onto their lead, winning with a final score of 16-15.

This quarter showcased the raw intensity and strategic depth of both teams, with the Saints managing to stave off a spirited Titans comeback to emerge victorious.

This 10-play, 76-yard drive lasted over 6 minutes, with notable contributions from Akers in the running game and a long pass from Stafford to Atwell for 44 yards. The Seahawks' response, however, was lackluster. Despite a penalty advantage on the kickoff, they were only able to muster a 3-play drive, gaining a mere 5 yards before having to punt. The Rams then showcased another impressive possession, amassing 60 yards over 9 plays. They faced some resistance from the Seahawks defense, resulting in them settling for a 38-yard field goal, furthering their lead to 17-13. The quarter ended with another weak drive from the Seahawks, who punted after 4 plays and a gain of only 10 yards. Crucially, the Seahawks' T.Lockett was injured during this drive. The Rams started another drive at the tail end of the third, which extended into the fourth quarter.

Q4:
The Rams continued their drive from the third quarter into the fourth, showing great ball control and game management. After a series of successful plays, including a crucial penalty against the Seahawks that placed the Rams just yards away from the endzone, the drive culminated in a touchdown, solidifying the Rams' control at 24-13. The Seahawks seemed to falter under the pressure, producing another unsuccessful drive, lasting only 3 plays and ending with a punt after gaining a paltry 2 yards. In contrast, the Rams maintained their momentum, stringing together a 9-play, 40-yard drive that, while stopped by the Seahawks' defense, still resulted in a field goal, pushing the Rams' lead to 27-13. The provided information ends during this Rams' drive.

Throughout the second half, the Rams showcased consistent offensive prowess and control, while the Seahawks struggled to mount any substantial response, reflected in their repeated short drives and reliance on punting.


Q1:

The first quarter began with the Pittsburgh Steelers gaining possession, but their first drive was uneventful, ending in a punt after K. Pickett was sacked, forcing a loss of 10 yards. San Francisco 49ers capitalized on their good starting field position on their first drive, pushing down the field with a mix of runs and passes. Highlighted by B. Purdy's 11-yard pass to G. Kittle on a 4th down conversion, the drive culminated in a touchdown, establishing an early 7-0 lead for the 49ers.

The Steelers’ next possession was short-lived; after gaining only 5 yards, K. Pickett threw an interception to C. Ward, giving the 49ers another opportunity. San Francisco made an initial push but found themselves stalling near the red zone. J. Moody attempted a 46-yard field goal that was blocked, but a penalty on P. Peterson allowed them to reattempt from a closer distance. Moody converted the 41-yard field goal, widening the gap to 10-0. The quarter concluded with the Steelers punting the ball after a failed drive, and the 49ers starting their next offensive push.

Q2:

San Francisco started the second quarter on a high note. Despite a penalty setting them back, B. Purdy connected with D. Samuel for a 22-yard gain, setting the 49ers up in the red zone. A few plays later, Purdy found B. Aiyuk in the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown pass, taking the score to 17-0 in favor of the 49ers.

Pittsburgh's offensive struggles continued into the second quarter. Their next possession began with a loss of 5 yards on a pass to J. Warren, compounded by an offensive holding penalty (which was declined). The drive ended in yet another punt after K. Pickett was sacked. The quarter summary is cut off, but the narrative so far shows the Steelers’ offensive struggles and the 49ers' ability to capitalize on their opportunities.

Q3:

The third quarter witnessed an offensive surge from the San Francisco 49ers and a struggle for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 49ers initiated with a quick 75-yard drive, taking just two plays and less than a minute. It began with a short pass from B.Purdy to D.Samuel, followed by a standout 65-yard rush from Christian McCaffrey for a touchdown, elevating the score to 27-7 in favor of the 49ers. The Steelers, in their subsequent drive, made a fair effort covering 30 yards in four plays, yet had to settle for a punt. This drive also saw an injury to D.Johnson, which might have impacted the Steelers' game plan. The 49ers' next possession was a mix of gains and losses, moving 23 yards in seven plays. B.Purdy and C.McCaffrey demonstrated some good connections, but T.Watt's impact was undeniable, as he managed to sack Purdy, forcing a punt for the 49ers. Unfortunately for the 49ers, their next possession saw a costly mistake; a sack by T.Watt on B.Purdy led to a fumble recovered by the Steelers. The quarter wrapped up with the Steelers marching 31 yards down the field, getting as close as the 49ers' 8-yard line, but they couldn’t capitalize, turning the ball over on downs.

Q4:

The fourth quarter started with the 49ers in possession, managing a commendable 47-yard drive before punting the ball. A notable moment in the drive was a 22-yard connection from B.Purdy to B.Aiyuk, though an injury to T.Williams became a concern for the 49ers. When the Steelers got the ball back, they looked promising, moving the ball 48 yards in seven plays. With quick passes from K.Pickett connecting with various receivers, they seemed to be finding some rhythm. However, the drive ended in despair for the Steelers, as an interception terminated their progression.

Throughout both quarters, the 49ers showcased their offensive prowess and defensive pressure. The Steelers, although demonstrating flashes of potential, struggled to maintain consistent momentum and capitalize on opportunities.
Q1:
The game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began with the Vikings receiving the kickoff. In their opening drive, the Vikings made minimal headway with a run by A.Mattison for 8 yards, before stalling due to a penalty and two incomplete passes. R.Wright's punt put the Buccaneers on their 33-yard line. Tampa Bay, led by quarterback B.Mayfield, was equally unproductive in their first possession, with Mayfield throwing three incomplete passes, leading to a punt.

The Vikings' second drive showed promise, with Cousins connecting with J.Jefferson for a significant gain of 30 yards. However, the drive was cut short on the Buccaneers' 26-yard line when Cousins fumbled, and the Buccaneers' J.Tryon recovered the ball. Tampa Bay once again struggled to make significant progress, culminating in a disputed pass completion that was eventually ruled incomplete. This led to another Buccaneers' punt. Minnesota's third drive of the quarter was brief and ended in disaster for the Vikings when K.Cousins was sacked and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the Buccaneers' A.Winfield.

Taking advantage of the turnover, the Buccaneers set up a scoring opportunity but were only able to muster a 36-yard field goal by C.McLaughlin, taking a 3-0 lead. The Vikings then responded with a short possession that ended in another punt. The Buccaneers closed out the quarter with a short possession, making a little headway and opting to punt early in the second quarter.

Q2:
The second quarter began with Tampa Bay's punt, returning the ball to Minnesota. The Vikings' next drive marked a turning point in the game. K.Cousins found J.Jefferson for a 25-yard gain, setting the tone for the drive. Subsequent plays, including an 18-yard pass to T.Chandler and a few rushing attempts, moved the Vikings downfield rapidly. The drive culminated in a touchdown, with details of the scoring play not provided in the summary. By the end of this summarized segment, the Vikings took the lead 7-3 over the Buccaneers.

Both teams showed glimpses of potential, with the Vikings capitalizing on a big drive in the second quarter. The Buccaneers, on the other hand, struggled with their offensive execution, settling for just a field goal despite a couple of crucial turnovers in their favor.


Q3:
The third quarter began with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers mounting a lengthy drive, lasting nearly 9 minutes, traversing 75 yards over 16 plays. Key contributors included R.White, who repeatedly advanced the ball on the ground, and B.Mayfield who connected multiple times with M.Evans and other receivers. The highlight came when B.Mayfield passed to C.Otton to reach the MIN 13-yard line, only to be followed by a 31-yard field goal attempt which was good but nullified due to a penalty against Minnesota. Nevertheless, this drive ended in a touchdown, putting the Buccaneers up by 7.

Minnesota Vikings answered back with a touchdown drive of their own, also covering 75 yards in 16 plays and consuming 7 minutes and 24 seconds. K.Cousins spread the ball to various receivers, notably a big 18-yard pass to J.Oliver that got them within striking distance. Despite a sack, Cousins managed to advance the ball with key passes, bringing the score level at 17-17 as the quarter concluded.

Q4:
Tampa Bay's next possession was short-lived, spanning only 5 plays, and 15 yards. This drive was punctuated by a crucial incomplete pass on third down, and then a punt, signaling a slight momentum shift.

Minnesota, however, could not capitalize on this momentum. Their subsequent drive was even shorter, covering just 3 yards in 3 plays, before they too were forced to punt the ball away.

Tampa Bay managed to get back into rhythm during their next drive. Starting on their own 23, the Buccaneers progressed 38 yards in 10 plays, over nearly 5 minutes. The drive witnessed Mayfield's key completions to M.Evans and a crucial 16-yard pass to C.Godwin, taking them into the Vikings' territory. Their effort culminated in a field goal, giving them a narrow 3-point lead, 20-17, in the latter stages of the game.

From the details provided, the game seems tightly contested, with both teams showing resilience and determination.



Sunday illustrated how high of a ceiling the 49ers offense has this season. Only four teams had a higher EPA per play in the first half of Week 1. That number is impressive as the team’s success rate was 42 percent, which is about three percent lower than the league average from last year.

For the full game, despite taking their foot off the gas, the 49ers finished 12th in success rate and seventh in EPA. Excessive penalties bogged those numbers down a bit. But you can’t be mad at a team that finished seventh in DVOA against a defense projected to finish inside the top 10.

Effective and efficient
The 49ers went 6-for-13 on third downs, and 2-for-3 in the red zone. A 46 percent conversion rate on third down was good for fifth-best in Week 1.

The Niners failed to convert on 3rd & 14, 7, 15, 6 (T.J. Watt sack), 2, and 8. The double-digit third downs were due to penalties. So, looking at it from a macro point of view, the team put themselves in ideal positions to convert.

The 49ers were second among all teams in yards per play, at 5.9. That’s a sustainable number for this offense. The only team higher, Mike McDaniel’s Miami Dolphins, finished with 8.2 yards per play. That’s something that happens in a video game.

Another way to look at the 49ers efficient outing is them having 66 plays and only getting to third down 13 times. That tells us they were winning enough on early downs.

McCaffrey moves the chains
Christian McCaffrey had 22 carries for 152 yards and a touchdown. Seven of those went for first downs. And, thanks to his spin move on the scoring run, a whopping 129 of those yards came after contact. McCaffrey averaged 5.9 yards after contact, which is an incredible number, with or without context.


The 49ers must be able to run the ball in between the tackles. CMC had five carries inside the tackles and averaged 8.4 yards a pop. Add in three forced missed tackles and you’re looking at a superb outing.

McCaffrey had three receptions on five targets. Only four running backs in Week 1 saw a higher percentage of their teams’ targets. Unlike most running backs, McCaffrey ran real routes and lined up as an actual receiver. It’s evident that he’s going to be a focal point of the 49ers passing game.

Big-time, Brandon
Two receivers had more yards than Brandon Aiyuk in Week 1: Tyreek Hill and Justin Jefferson. Unlike those two, Aiyuk didn’t have a long, 40+ play.

Every one of Aiyuk’s receptions went for a first down. He had a perfect passer rating his way. And put on an absolute clinic as a blocker. Kyle Shanahan was asked what’s different about Aiyuk this year than in year’s past:

“More consistent. I thought he came a long way last year in that, as the year went, I think that’s why he ended up leading our team in receiving, and he’s carried that into the offseason. Didn’t know if he was going to get all those opportunities going to the game. You never know how it’s going to play out, but he got eight opportunities, and he came down with all eight of them.

That doesn’t always mean you get more. Sometimes that means you get more attention, and they take it away, which helps out other people. So, you never know which direction it’s going to go each week. But the coolest thing about B.A. is how ready he came to play regardless. You see him on some of those run plays and stuff and from the beginning to the end.

And usually when he is like that in the run game, it carries over to the pass game. The pass game’s just a little more out of your control, but yesterday it all fell to him, and he was ready for the moment and had a big-time game.”

You better believe opposing defenses will give Aiyuk more attention moving forward. If I’m them, I’m making anybody else beat me. Make Deebo Samuel prove he can consistently get open. It’s easier said than done, but Aiyuk’s route running is on another level.

Purdy punishes Pittsburgh
Here’s a 20-minute video breaking down some of the nuances from Brock Purdy, Aiyuk getting open, and the 49ers offense flourishing against the Steelers:


Purdy was incredible. That may not be reflective in the box score, but some of the plays he made with his legs and escape ability were next level. It was a minor miracle that Purdy was only sacked three times.

Per Sports Info Solutions, 89 percent of Purdy’s throws were catchable. Even better, 74.5 percent of his yards came through the air, which was a league high for Week 1. It’s a limited sample size, but I’m not sure there’s much of anything to complain about from Purdy when you put into context who he went against and what he’s coming off of.



very clear that the San Francisco 49ers grabbed everyone's attention with their dominant 30-7 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 1. Entering the regular season, most power rankings had at least the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles ahead of Kyle Shanahan's squad.

No more.

On Sunday, the 49ers earned analysts' respect with their performance at Acrisure Stadium. The team was playing at a championship level on both sides of the football, with quarterback Brock Purdy proving his doubters wrong, hitting his playmakers in the passing game, and letting running back Christian McCaffrey do McCaffrey-type things on the ground.

On the other side of the ball, with the focus on reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa, defensive linemen like Drake Jackson and Javon Hargrave gave fans 2019-season vibes, causing pressure and racking up sacks. Just imagine what this unit can do once more is asked of Bosa, who joined his teammates late after ending a six-week-long holdout.

The 49ers look like a force and quickly jump to the top of NFL rankings. They'll look to continue their early momentum this weekend against the Los Angeles Rams in a battle between the NFC West's only undefeated teams.

"If Sunday's win over the Steelers was any indication, Purdy's no fluke—and the Niners are one of the best teams in the NFL. There was very little that didn't go well against the Steelers. Purdy threw a pair of touchdown passes and posted a passer rating of 111.3. Both running back Christian McCaffrey and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk had huge games. And the San Francisco defense held the Steelers to 239 total yards and seven points." — NFL Staff

"Best debut performance: DT Javon Hargrave. Apologies to rookie kicker Jake Moody, who had a flawless debut, but Hargrave's presence on the interior sparked a dominant performance by the defensive line. The Niners had the best defense in the league last season without getting much pressure from the interior, but Hargrave and a healthy Arik Armstead look intent on changing that in a significant way." — Nick Wagoner

"The 49ers dominated the first half against the Steelers and delivered the knockout blow to Pittsburgh two plays into the third quarter. Christian McCaffrey's 65-yard run started with perfect execution up front. McCaffrey spun past the Steelers' Levi Wallace and was aided by blocks from WRs Brandon Aiyukand Ray-Ray McCloud III. It was just a devastating play from a 49ers offense that was in full command on the road in Week 1. I suspected San Francisco's defense would pick up where it left off, and it did just that. But the offensive explosion was the Week 1 headline, answering any questions anyone might have about the ability or health of QB Brock Purdy. Truly brilliant stuff." — Eric Edholm

"Hard to begin more impressively than flying cross-country and beating another (supposed) contender by 23 points in their own building. The Niners dominated in every phase at Pittsburgh on Sunday, and second-year QB Brock Purdy built upon the historic start of his career. 'Mr. Irrelevant' from the 2022 draft, he's the first passer in league annals with a QB rating of at least 95.0 in his first six regular-season starts and the first to win his first six non-playoff starts while notching at least a pair of TD throws in each. Purdy's lone loss remains January's NFC title game defeat at Philadelphia, when his UCL snapped early in the game.

"The 49ers dominated the Steelers from the jump. Despite having legitimate question marks on the offensive line and with a QB coming off a major injury, the team had absolutely no problem thoroughly dismantling the Steelers defense. And it seems there should be no concern about DeMeco Ryans' departure as the defensive play-caller. After all, this is still Kyle Shanahan's defense." — Dalton Miller

In recent years, the 49ers stumbled out of the gate with sub-.500 records after five to seven games and it has cost them the No. 1 seed in the NFC Playoffs. Deebo Samuel said the team wants to win early to get the No. 1 seed this year, and they’re off to a good start with a dominant 30-7 win over Pittsburgh.

For the first time since 2019, Kyle Shanahan’s 49ers are playing for January in September. This 2023 team is showing some parallels on a mix of running and the short passing game on offense; and collapsing the pocket from the middle on defense.


Game Balls

After each game, I will hand out four game balls. There were many worthy contributors to this win. I put this quartet at the top.

Brandon Aiyuk – A career-high 129 yards, the fifth time in his career he’s gone over 100 yards in a game. Aiyuk left a slipping Patrick Peterson for his first touchdown, made a perfect catch on a perfect back-shoulder throw from Brock Purdy for his 2nd, and set up a third in a withering block on Christian McCaffrey’s 65-yard TD run. The camp reports said Aiyuk has taken it up a level, here’s the proof.


Christian McCaffrey – 169 yards in total offense, his 152 on the ground is the 4th highest game of his career. McCaffrey is the engine of the offense and the primary reason the team is scoring in the 30s regularly. As a result, maintaining CMC’s health is paramount.

For a stretch in the 4th quarter up 20 points, Shanahan called nine touches in ten plays for McCaffrey. Shanahan must improve at rotations and usage. This is not sustainable and it’s reckless.


Kyle Shanahan – Other than milking McCaffrey late, Shanahan was brilliant. His team was ready from kickoff, execution was crisp and confident, and targets were schemed wide open. In past years the offense had to find its way through the early games. Since engineering the McCaffrey trade, the Niners know exactly who they are on offense – one of the very best in the league.

Arik Armstead – Finally healthy, Armstead was a wrecking ball, consistently flushing Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett out of the pocket - and into turnovers or Drake Jackson. 


In 2019 with DeForest Buckner, the Niners' interior pass rush collapsed the pocket or forced double teams. With Armstead healthy and the signing of Javon Hargrave, they have that formula back, and Pickett cracked.

Penalty Flags

Colton McKivitz – Steelers edge T.J. Watt had three sacks, including a strip sack that Purdy fumbled and lost. McKivitz had more success in the first half when the team was adept at avoiding 3rd and long. 


It seems that McKivitz got tired in the second half, he was out of position for the Watt sacks. A possible solution would be to platoon him, but the Niner depth can’t fill that role.  This is T.J. Watt All-Pro but the season may come down to McKivitz in pass protection against Haason Reddick 2nd-Team All-Pro. 

Spencer Burford – Three penalties: holding, a face mask, and offsides. Some great blocks in the running game though.


Team Takeaways

The value of continuity.

Unlike recent years, the team came into the year with no changes and no uncertainty at starting quarterback. They knew what to expect in Purdy, that Shanahan would scheme the receivers open and Purdy would hit them with precise timing. 

4/5ths of the offensive line is intact, where continuity is key to success. All of the weapons are back. As a result, no slow start for the offense struggling to find its identity this year. No reinventing the wheel, no big adjustments, the offense could hit the ground running - and played like it. Immediately.


On defense, coordinator Steve Wilks faced many unknowns with the starters not playing together until Pittsburgh, but he applied a similar approach. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Let the investment in the line set up the defense and roll with the same coverages and similar blitz packages.

In 2019 the Niners collapsed the interior pocket to take a quarterback out of his timing and rhythm. Now every 2023 opponent going forward will have to deal with the same thing. Quarterbacks who struggle in muddy pockets throw off-target and can turn the ball over. Pickett in this game, Dak Prescott in last year's playoffs.


The value of the big investment in the defensive line is reflected in the numbers against Pittsburgh. Seven points, six three-play drives, five sacks, nine hits, eight tackles for loss, and 30 pressures on 51 dropbacks (per NextGen Stats).

I thought the defense would need to find its way over the course of the game. It took the Steelers 28 minutes and 44 seconds to get a first down.

The team’s focus and mindset reveal a heightened readiness.

The players know they have a shot at the No. 1 seed, they know it’s their best path back to the Super Bowl, and they played like a team on a mission. They came to Pittsburgh ready. Distractions, Nick Bosa signs last minute, no problem. The game was over in the 2nd quarter.


Another benefit of their focus and mindset is that it builds on itself. Initial success creates additional motivation to keep it going.

For the first time in the Shanahan Era, this team looks hungry for hardware. Their focus and execution speak to a team that wants more than a Final Four appearance this year.

It’s just one game, key weaknesses remain, and they have a long way to go, but it’s a promising start.



SANTA CLARA — The 49ers have gotten off to shaky starts to the season too often under coach Kyle Shanahan.

After a training camp dominated by a lengthy contract holdout from the team's best defensive player Nick Bosa, the trading away of the former future franchise quarterback Trey Lance and the rehabilitation of the starting QB Brock Purdy, there were questions about whether that could change this season.

Considered those answered.

The Niners opened the season in dominating fashion, going on the road to overwhelm the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-7 on Sunday in a performance that showed why San Francisco is once again considered one of the leading contenders in the NFC.

“It was exactly how we wanted to come out,” All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner said. “It was an emphasis on, you know, past seasons, us coming out with slow starts. We knew that we needed to come in and set the tone right from the jump.”

The 49ers (1-0) led 20-0 before allowing the Steelers to generate a single first down on offense and didn't let up much after that.

Purdy answered any questions about the health of his throwing elbow by throwing two TD passes to Brandon Aiyuk six months to the day after undergoing surgery.

Bosa showed few signs of rust following his holdout and led the way for a defense that made Kenny Pickett uncomfortable all game.

Even rookie kicker Jake Moody got into the act after a shaky preseason, making all three field goals and extra points.

It all added up to San Francisco's most lopsided road win in Week 1 since 1986 when they won 31-7 at Tampa Bay.

“My goal for the team was to play with the right intent,” Shanahan said. “How hard we went from the first play to the last play, I was really proud of our team in that way. The defense shut them down those first three plays, three and out, to really set the tone.”

What’s working
Purdy completed 19 of 29 passes for 220 yards and became the first QB in NFL history to win his first six regular-season starts, while throwing at least two TD passes in each game. His connection with Aiyuk was particularly sharp, as he completed all eight passes he threw him for 129 yards and two TDs. Aiyuk became the first Niners receiver to have at least 100 yards receiving and two TDs in the opener since J.J. Stokes in 1998.

What needs help
End of first half. It's a stretch to find much that went wrong for the Niners outside of the final two minutes of the first half. They threw three straight incompletions after getting to the Steelers 37. Then after a punt, they allowed Pittsburgh to drive 95 yards in 1:25 for the longest regular-season TD drive against San Francisco in 10 years.

Stock up
DE Drake Jackson. Relegated to the bench late in his rookie season, Jackson emerged in Week 1 as a viable pass rushing threat opposite of Bosa. Jackson's three sacks matched his total from all of last season. He joined Bryant Young (2005) and Jeff Stover (1986) for the most sacks in an opener in franchise history.

Stock down
RT Colton McKivitz. The biggest question on offense headed into the season was how McKivitz would handle a starting role after Mike McGlinchey left in free agency. The results in Week 1 weren't great as he allowed five pressures and three sacks, according to Pro Football Focus. The one caveat is that McKivitz won't have to face a pass rusher as tough as T.J. Watt most weeks.

“He had the toughest matchup on the field,” Shanahan said. “There were definitely a number of plays where Watt got him, a couple of situations we could have helped him with chips and stuff.”

Injuries
The Niners came out of the game healthy as CB Ambry Thomas cleared concussion protocol during the game and again on Monday.

Key number
152. Christian McCaffrey ran for 152 yards on 22 carries for the third-best Week 1 rushing performance in franchise history. McCaffrey scored on a 65-yard run to give him a touchdown in 10 straight games, including the playoffs. That's two shy of Jerry Rice's franchise record set in 1987.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa has been back with his team for only two days, but he left no doubt Friday that he intends to play Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

"I'm confident," Bosa said. "I'm not sure what [coach] Kyle [Shanahan's] plan is, but I would be up for [a] normal workload, for sure."

Bosa, speaking to Bay Area media for the first time since signing a record-setting five-year, $170 million contract extension that includes $122.5 million in guarantees Friday morning, took part in practice on a limited basis Thursday and then was listed as a full participant in San Francisco's half-speed Friday session.

On Wednesday, Shanahan indicated he expected Bosa to play Sunday, joking that the only way that wouldn't happen is if Bosa showed up with a "beer belly." That did not happen and the Niners were sufficiently pleased with how Bosa returned after a 43-day holdout.

"He looked exactly how we were expecting him to look," Shanahan said. "Looks in real good shape. Looks ready to go. We got an idea how we're going to use him and I think he'll do all right."

As for how much Bosa will play against the Steelers, that remains to be seen. Defensive coordinator Steve Wilks said Thursday that would be determined by how the game goes.

"It is not really trying to put a limit on what he can do," Wilks said. "It's just trying to get a feel, and once we get into the game and then go from there."

In the bigger picture, Bosa expressed excitement and relief that he will get to play his snaps for the 49ers well beyond Sunday's game. After his 2022 Defensive Player of the Year campaign, Bosa said multiple times he was confident a new contract would be hammered out either before or right after training camp opened on July 25.

With no deal in hand, Bosa spent the past six weeks at home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, while his agent, Brian Ayrault, negotiated the largest contract in terms of annual value and guarantees for a non-quarterback in NFL history.

The waiting game made for some tense moments, up to and including wondering whether a deal would even get done, Bosa acknowledged.

"There's certain points throughout it that are more stressful than others," Bosa said. "But I trust the team around me and I know that they have my best interest in mind. And I trusted the 49ers organization and all of them to work well with my guys. I had trust all along, but it definitely was stressful."

After the deal was completed early Wednesday evening, Bosa flew to the Bay Area and arrived late that night. He did some work on the side and individual drills in Thursday's practice and followed up by doing a little bit more Friday, though that practice is conducted at more of a walk-through pace.

To make room for Bosa, the Niners released veteran defensive end Austin Bryant on Friday. Bosa will be activated on Saturday.


With Bosa back in the fold, the Niners enter the opener relatively healthy. The team had 13 players listed on the injury report this week, but only two were not cleared to go on Friday's final status report.

Tight end George Kittle (groin) and cornerback Charvarius Ward (heel) are listed as questionable for Sunday. Both players were limited in Friday's practice. Kittle was a limited participant in all three practices this week. Among the players who are cleared to play after dealing with injuries this week: safety Talanoa Hufanga (knee), kicker Jake Moody (quad), safety Tashaun Gipson (back), linebacker Oren Burks (knee), running back Jordan Mason (foot) and receiver/returner Ray-Ray McCloud (wrist).

That should put Moody, the No. 99 pick in this year's NFL draft, in line to handle kicking duties in his first regular-season game, answering one of the team's biggest injury questions coming out of the preseason.

CHICAGO -- The Bears struggled throughout training camp. They struggled to stay healthy, to find a rhythm on offense, and to find continuity on defense.

The Bears' starters didn't play in the second preseason game because the staff viewed their work in joint practices as good enough. All told, the Bears' starters played somewhere between four and six series in the preseason. Some starters didn't play at all.

More work was needed, and it showed Sunday as the Bears were decapitated by the Green Bay Packers 38-20 at Soldier Field.

The offensive game plan was useless. The "revamped" defense didn't communicate, tackle, or pressure the quarterback. Maybe it was a late arrival on the CTA?

A three-hour debacle on the lakefront washed away an offseason of hype and excitement. The Week 1 report card reflects a performance that left everyone hoping it was rock bottom but fearing it was just the beginning.

Passing Offense
Any time the Bears talk about quarterback Justin Fields, they talk about how great of a deep ball thrower he is and how they want to utilize it.

Could have fooled me.

The Bears' offensive game plan, the one they had months to put together, called for a heavy dose of screen passes and quick-game work.

Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy's initial plan didn't yield great results, but the Bears stubbornly stuck with it until the fat lady had sung, changed her clothes, and hopped in an Uber for the airport.

Fields finished the day 24-for-37 for 216 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. But he finished the game with a career-low 4.1 air yards per attempt, per ESPN Stats and Info. Fields threw just five passes that traveled 10 yards or more in the air. He went 2-for-5 with a touchdown and an interception.

Fields threw 37 passes and dropped back 45 times. Despite that high number of dropbacks, Bears wide receivers accounted for just 13 total targets, with Darnell Mooney getting seven.

DJ Moore caught two passes on two targets on back-to-back plays in the second quarter and was not heard from again. Chase Claypool caught zero passes on two targets and was less than a non-factor.

The Bears' inability to find a way to get the ball in Moore or Claypool's hands is a massive indictment of Getsy's game plan and an offensive line that allowed Fields to be pressured on 42 percent of his dropbacks.

The game plan was putrid. The offensive line play was worse.

A unit that hadn't taken a snap together all preseason looked like it Sunday.

Left tackle Braxton Jones had a day to forget, center Lucas Patrick was bullied at the point of attack, and guards Cody Whitehair and Nate Davis were unspectacular in pass protection.

Fields was OK on Sunday. He executed the game plan and went through his progressions well at times. But it was nothing to write home about.

Fields Grade: C
Passing Game Grade: D-

Rushing Offense
Running the ball was the only thing the Bears did well in 2022.

Even that didn't work Sunday.

The Bears' ground game couldn't gain any traction Sunday. Fields rushed nine times for 59 yards but fumbled in a critical spot.

Outside of FIelds, the Bears rushed 20 times for 63 yards, including a tight end sneak by Cole Kmet on the first drive of the game that didn't pick up the 1-yard needed for a first down.

The Bears got no push up front and couldn't open the desired lanes for Khalil Herbert and D'Onta Foreman.

Rookie Roschon Johnson was the lone bright spot, rushing for 20 yards and a touchdown on five carries.

The NFL kicked off the 2023 season in style with the league's oldest rivalry, the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers, but it was the newest starting quarterback in this storied matchup, Jordan Love -- who sat for three seasons behind four-time NFL MVP and Super Bowl champion Aaron Rodgers -- earned a familiar result, a victory, with the help of a familiar face, Packers Pro Bowl running back Aaron Jones. Love's 245 passing yards and three passing touchdowns on 15 of 27 passing were critical in the Green and Gold securing a 38-20 road victory over the Bears. Eighty-six of Love's 245 yards through the air, 35%, came with Jones on the receiving end with a 51-yard catch-and-run on a screen pass as well as a 35-yard catch-and-run touchdown on a second-half fourth down. 

The Pro Bowl running back and the Packers' sole Aaron remaining in Green Bay, Jones totaled 127 yards from scrimmage on 11 touches -- 41 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown plus 86 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown on two catches. That duo along with second-year receiver Romeo Doubs, who caught eight-yard and four-yard touchdowns from Love, helped provide the Chicago crowd at Soldier Field with a familiar feeling of disappointment following another defeat. This result occurred even though Rodgers, their longtime bogeyman, was halfway across the country in New Jersey, readying for his New York Jets debut against the Buffalo Bills on "Monday Night Football."

Love's afternoon began in Bears territory after the Packers stuffed Chicago on third and fourth down with a yard to gain at their own 40. Chicago attempted a direct snap to tight end Cole Kmet. Green Bay stifled that plunge, and then the Bears tried it again with quarterback Justin Fields under center. Both times, no dice with only a yard to gain. Love's first throw of his debut as the Packers starting quarterback hit second-year wideout Romeo Doubs for a 13-yard gain and a first down on 3rd-and-13, a sign of things to come.  

He capped his first drive as the Packers full-time starting quarterback with an 8-yard touchdown toss to Doubs on third-and-goal. Doubs hit the Bears secondary with a double move before running an in-breaking route to get open in the middle of the end zone for the score. Love rifled the football right into Doubs' chest for the first touchdown of the contest. 

The Bears' next two drives both concluded with made field goals from kicker Cairo Santos (47 and 29 yards) after third-down incompletions by Fields short-circuited Chicago possessions. The 29-yard kick near the goal line came after the Packers' 13th overall pick of the 2023 NFL Draft, defensive end Lukas Van Ness, introduced himself to Fields. On second and goal from the four, Van Ness flushed Fields out toward the right sideline after play-action fake out of the shotgun and then hurled the Bears dual-threat quarterback out of bounds for a 7-yard loss. 


Confusing clock management on Green Bay's final drive of the half forced the Green and Gold to settle for a 52-yard field goal. Following a second-and-10 sack by new Bears defensive end Yannick Ngakoue at the Chicago 26, Green Bay was pushed back to the 34. LaFleur curiously opted to let the clock run down to four seconds before burning the Packers' final timeout. 

Packers rookie sixth-round pick kicker Anders Carlson blasted a 52-yard field goal, his first regular-season field goal attempt right up the middle of the uprights to give Green Bay an extra three points as time expired in the first half. Green Bay took a 10-6 lead into the locker room at Solider Field, and they began the second half with the football.   

After only five carries for 24 rushing yards in the first half, LaFleur featured Jones to open the second half. His 51-yard catch-and-run off a screen pass from Love drove the Packers down to the Bears seven, putting them near the goal line. His final play of the drive, a one-yard scamper into the end zone, concluded the possession with a touchdown. That gave the Packers a 17-6 advantage over the Bears early in the third quarter. 

The Packers starting running back totaled 17 rushing yards and a touchdown on four carries as well as the one catch for 51 yards for a grand total of 68 yards of scrimmage and a touchdown on five touches during the eight-play scoring march. 

Later on, facing a fourth-and-three from the Bears 35, LaFleur went for a potential kill shot and a three-possession lead midway though the third quarter. Love and Jones provided that punch after the quarterback hit his running back over the middle on an option route, and Jones did the rest, sprinting away for a 35-yard catch-and-run touchdown. The Packers led  the Bears 24-6 with 6:26 left in the third quarter after that massive fourth-down conversion. 

However, Jones suffered a potential scare at the tail end of his second touchdown of the day. He visibly grabbed his hamstring/quad area as he galloped into the end zone. Per Fox Sports' Erin Andrews on the television broadcast, Jones told his teammates on the sidelines that he was fine. He did not return to the game after the injury, likely because the game was out of reach. 

Fields and the Bears eventually clapped back with a touchdown following a 20-yard touchdown toss from the quarterback to fourth-year receiver Darnell Mooney. Chicago converted the ensuing two-point conversion on a shotgun handoff to running back Khalil Herbert to trim the Green Bay lead down to 10, 24-14 , entering the fourth quarter. 

A wild sequence of events then resulted in a familiar outcome: another Love touchdown pass to Doubs. On third down and three from the Bears' 41, Love fumbled the snap, but he scooped it up and hurled it deep down the left sideline to rookie tight end Luke Musgrave who broke wide open after all the chaos. 

That play set up the Packers with a first-and-goal four yards away from the end zone. Love found Doubs in the back left corner via a goal line fade route for the duo's second scoring strike of the afternoon on the very next play, pushing the Green Bay lead up back up to 17 points, 31-14, with 13:34 left in the game. 


The wheels completely came off the Bears' wagon three plays later after Packers inside linebacker Quay Walker stepped in front of a Fields' throw intended for Mooney, and he spun away from potential tacklers to return the takeaway 37 yards for a pick-six touchdown, running up the score to 38-14 Packers with 12:36 left in the game. Fields finished the afternoon with 216 passing yards, one passing touchdown and an interception that was returned for a touchdown on 24-of-37 passing. His 59 rushing yards on nine carries led all players in the game Sunday, but he did not find the end zone on the ground. Bears rookie fifth-round running back Roschon Johnson added a garbage time, two-yard rushing touchdown for Chicago's final points. 

Here's an in-depth look at why Green Bay ran away from Chicago with some key takeaways. 

Why the Packers won 
Love out-played Fields and made big throw after big throw on third down, fourth down and in the red zone. He completed seven of his nine third-down throws for 106 passing yards and the eight-yard touchdown to Doubs on their opening drive. Love's only fourth-down throw ended up as a dart into Jones' chest, which allowed his running back to make the catch in stride and break away for a 35-yard touchdown. Two of his four red zone passes were completed, both touchdown to Doubs. Love wasn't just checking the ball down, he hit on deep and intermediate throws all over the field for the entirety of Sunday afternoon. 

Green Bay concluded all of their red zone trips with touchdowns -- two Love touchdown tosses to Doubs and Jones' one-yard touchdown run. Jones provided critical production to break the game open in the second half, and that was about it. As the Packers' lead grew, the Green Bay defense's defensive line continued to get more and more pressure on Fields, which allowed them to force two turnovers.  

They were able to coerce a forced fumble and a pick-six of Fields, two plays that closed the door on the host Bears. Walker's 37-yard interception return ran the score up to 38-14 early in the fourth quarter, sealing the deal for the Green and Gold. 

Why the Bears lost 
Fields couldn't keep pace with Love. He appeared to be the full-time starter for the first time instead of Love, and Love appeared to be the quarterback entering his third year as a starter, not Fields. The Chicago quarterback was unable to connect with Moore, his new WR1, only targeting him twice, which resulted in 25 yards on two catches. 

Until Fields can get in a rhythm throwing the football to Moore and others, the Bears offense will continue to be one-dimensional, thus making them any easy team to prepare to play against. 

Turning point 
Aaron Jones' 35-yard catch-and-run touchdown in the third quarter with the Packers facing a fourth-down and three. Green Bay already led 17-6 after Jones' one-yard touchdown run on the previous drive, but this play broke Chicago's will. Any idea that they could rattle Love on the road in his first start as the Packers full-time starter completely dissipated after he hit Jones in stride for a score that put Green Bay up 18, 24-6. 


Play of the game 
Packers inside linebacker Quay Walker's 37-yard pick-six of Justin Fields that gave Green Bay a 38-14 lead, a 24-point margin, with just under 13 minutes left in the game. He followed Fields' eyes and easily stepped in front of his throw to corral the football. Then, he hit Bears would-be tacklers with some sweet moves. First, there was a broken tackle by putting his shoulder into running back Roschon Johnson's chest, and then Walker hit tight end Cole Kmet with a spin move to reverse field and finish the return in the end zone. Incredible agility and vision as a ball-carrier for someone who doesn't usually have the football in his hands. 


What's next
The 1-0 Packers hit the road in Week 2 and head down south to face the 1-0 Atlanta Falcons. The Dirty Birds won their season opener 24-10 at home against the NFC South rival Carolina Panthers. The 0-1 Bears will also be on the move in Week 2 to face an NFC South opponent, the 1-0 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Quarterback Baker Mayfield threw two touchdowns in his Buccaneers debut as Tampa Bay topped the reigning NFC North champion Minnesota Vikings 20-17 on the road. 



CHICAGO -- The "new era" of the Bears-Green Bay Packers rivalry officially got underway at Soldier Field on Sunday.

It looked a lot like the old era.

The Packers roared out to a 24-7 lead in the third quarter behind dominant play on both lines and better execution in critical situations.

Quarterback Justin Fields brought the Bears back to within 10, but Packers quarterback Jordan Love immediately answered with a touchdown drive of his own to stretch the lead back to 17.

On the ensuing Bears possession, Packers linebacker Quay Walker picked off Fields and took it back to the house to drive the final nail in the Bears' coffin. Love finished the game 15-for-27 for 245 yards and three touchdowns.

Here's what we learned in the Bears' season-opening 38-20 loss vs. the Packers:

Schrock: Jordan Love's easy day highlights how Bears fail Justin Fields
The Bears' first half was littered with missed opportunities.

The Bears' season got off to an inauspicious start.

Faced with a third-and-1 on their opening drive, the Bears opted to run a TE sneak with Cole Kmet, but the Packers snuffed it out for no gain. Head coach Matt Eberflus rolled the dice early, electing to go for it on fourth-and-1 from his own 40.

This time, the Bears tried a quarterback sneak, but Preston Smith stopped Fields for no gain, giving the Packers an early gift.

Love took advantage of the short field position and led the Packers on an 11-play, 40-yard drive that he capped off with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Romeo Doubs on third-and-goal.

Attempting to author a quick answer, the Bears' offense quickly moved into Packers territory thanks to a 23-yard pass from Fields to Darnell Mooney. But the drive stalled after that as Chase Claypool dropped a tipped pass on third-and-7 to bring out kicker Cairo Santos for a 47-yard field goal.

After forcing another three-and-out, the Bears' offense marched right back into Packers territory as back-to-back passes from Fields to DJ Moore put the Bears inside the 10-yard line.

But the Bears once again were unable to finish off the drive.

Packers rookie Lukas Van Ness sacked Fields on second-and-goal, and Rasul Douglas broke up a third-and-goal pass for Kmet to force the Bears to kick another field goal.

Sluggish offense
On Sunday, the Bears' offense looked like a unit that failed to find a consistent rhythm during training camp.

A running attack that was one of the best in the NFL in 2022 struggled to gain any traction in the first half. If you take out Fields' five rushes for 36 yards, the Bears rushed 11 times for 22 yards. The offensive line, which hasn't played together due to injuries, was pushed around up front.

In the passing game, the Bears focused on the screen and short game, something the Packers' defense quickly caught on to in the first half. Fields was an efficient 10-for-14 for 96 yards at half, but the lack of creativity in the passing game is concerning.

The offense didn't get better in the second half.

The Bears started their first drive of the third quarter with a play-action pass deep in their own end zone. Left tackle Braxton Jones missed his assignment, allowing Devonte Wyatt to easily sack Fields for a loss of 11. A screen pass to D'Onta Foreman and a short pass to Roschon Johnson forced the Bears to punt, leading to the first wave of boos at Soldier Field.

The Bears' only signs of offensive life came when the Packers already had them pinned on the mat.

Down 18, the Bears opened up the playbook a bit and got some help from Packers penalties to finally find the end zone as Fields hit Mooney for a 20-yard score. A successful two-point conversion cut the lead to 10.

The touchdown play was perfectly designed and executed. Mooney and Claypool's route combinations worked perfectly to spring Mooney open, the offensive line picked up the blitz, and Fields delivered a strike for six.


Fields finished the game 24-for-37 for 216 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. The offensive issues don't fall on his shoulders. The play-calling was predictable and uninventive, the line looked like it hadn't played together, and the receivers didn't consistently separate.

Outcoached
Questionable coaching decisions from Eberflus, offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, and defensive coordinator Alan Williams were all over Sunday's debacle.

We already touched on the decision to go for it on fourth-and-1 from their own 40 to start the game. I didn't necessarily hate the decision, but the Bears not running the Eagles' "tush push" to gain 1 yard was a whiff.

On the offensive side of the ball, Getsy's assistance in sticking with a screen game that was largely ineffective led to the boobirds arriving early in the third quarter.

The drive that ended in the Bears' second field had a particularly maddening sequence. Back-to-back passes to Moore got the Bears inside the 10, but Moore came out of the game after the second reception. The Bears ended up going backward on first and second down before Moore re-entered on third down.

On the defensive side of the ball, the Bears made some curious defensive line substitutions in critical situations.

On their first drive, the Packers faced a critical third-and-goal from the 8-yard line. Needing a pass rush, the Bears trotted out a defensive line of Dominique Robinson, DeMarcus Walker, Andrew Billings, and Yannick Ngakoue. That unit got no push, Love patted the ball once and threw a dart to Doubs for a touchdown.

On the Packers' first touchdown drive of the second half, the Bears once again needed a stop in the red zone and mixed up their defensive line rotation, going with Rasheem Green, Justin Jones, Gervon Dexter, and Ngakoue. Again, it proved ineffective as Aaron Jones plunged into the end zone to give them a 17-6 lead.

The defensive line rotations were curious and didn't seem to line up with the situations. The Bears needed juice off the edge in the first situation, but the Packers stonewalled Robinson. They needed Billings on the field to guard against the run in the second situation, and instead, the Packers punished Jones and Dexter.

The Bears are now 3-24 in their last 27 games against the Packers. As long as they continue to be outcoached and outexecuted, that won't change for a while.

We recap it here:

Offense: Off to Rocky Start

Quinn Harris/Getty Images

Right from the opening whistle, Chicago’s offense appeared disjointed. Fields completed 24-of-37 passes for 216 yards. He found the end zone once and threw a costly pick-six. With high expectations this season, Fields’ performance left many questions unanswered.

Receiver DJ Moore, the anticipated offseason catch, had an unusually silent game with only two receptions for 25 yards. In contrast, Fields consistently eyed receiver Darnell Mooney, who ended with a team-high 53 receiving yards and a touchdown.

However, not all woes can be attributed to Fields. The revamped offensive line, touted as an offseason strength, wilted under Green Bay’s relentless pass rush, giving up four sacks. Matt Eberflus undoubtedly has this vulnerability on his radar.

On the brighter side, rookie running back Roschon Johnson offered a ray of hope. With 55 all-purpose yards and a touchdown, he’s shaping up to be a potential future RB1.


Defense: Packers Run Rampant

Michael Reaves/Getty Images

The Bears’ offense faltered, but it was the defense that indeed caught the eye – for the wrong reasons. Coming off a season where they held one of the league’s most porous defenses, they seemed unprepared for Green Bay.

Quarterback Jordan Love, stepping in for the departed Aaron Rodgers, had a field day. Completing 15-of-27 passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns, Love exuded confidence, particularly evident in a 61-yard touchdown drive, pushing Green Bay further ahead after the Bears had clawed back to a 10-point deficit.

Running back Aaron Jones continued his dominance over Chicago, recording 127 scrimmage yards, including a 35-yard touchdown reception. He suffered a hamstring injury on that scoring play and didn’t return.


Looking Ahead: Facing the Buccaneers

Quinn Harris/Getty Images

Losing in Week 1 is hard; losing to a long-time rival is even more challenging. The Bears must tighten their defense and hone their offense to rebound against the Buccaneers.

The journey ahead is lengthy; a single game shouldn’t set the tone. But with an 11-game skid hanging over them, the Bears are eager to rediscover the winning formula. The potential is there, and a passionate fan base backs them. It’s high time they regroup and turn the tide.


Injuries

Michael Reaves/Getty Images

Second-year cornerback Kyler Gordon left the game in the second half with a hand injury. He did not return.



Cincinnati Bengals coach Zac Taylor had a simple message to his team after its season-opening loss at Cleveland.

“This certainly isn’t the team we’re going to be, and we all understand that,” Taylor said in his post-game press conference when asked what he told the players.


Despite expectations being higher than ever coming off back-to-back AFC Championship appearances, the Bengals struggled out of the gate, falling 24-3 to the Browns on Sunday in the 100th “Battle of Ohio” matchup. An offense that didn’t get any first-team preseason snaps together looked not surprisingly out of sync considering the team had the equivalent of just two weeks of practices with starting quarterback Joe Burrow.

Here are five takeaways from the loss to the Browns.

1. Yet another slow start

ADVERTISING


Burrow hasn’t had a normal training camp yet but his last two were impacted more than his first two in terms of how much throwing he was doing with his receivers, and he looked almost equally as sloppy in both openers in 2022 and 2023.

The fourth-year quarterback missed five weeks because of a right calf injury and although he was physically in a better place than when he came back from an appendectomy last year, he only had a week and a half to get up to speed with his receivers prior to Sunday. It didn’t help the Bengals were facing a defense they’ve struggled with in the past.

PHOTOS: Bengals vs. Browns
As a result, the Bengals were shut out in the first half, and the offense amassed just 142 yards while Burrow threw for a career-low 82 yards the day after inking a five-year, $275 million extension. He had just 36 yards in the first half, Cincinnati punted on all seven drives before halftime and Burrow completed just 45.2 percent of his passes for the game.


In his post-game press conference, Burrow said his calf was “good enough.”

2. Higgins shut out

Tee Higgins didn’t land a catch despite Burrow throwing to him eight times, and while some of that might have been the effect of Burrow’s accuracy being off, it just seemed like the two of them were not on the same page.

On a couple of occasions, Burrow was looking for Higgins in a certain spot and he wasn’t anywhere near the throw.

Wide receiver Tyler Boyd said Friday that Higgins “got the short end of the stick” not getting a contract extension this summer, so perhaps there is a mental aspect to negotiations hanging over him. Last year, Jessie Bates said he felt like his first half of the season was impacted by added pressure of trying to earn a contract, but Burrow chalked up miscommunications with his receivers to “just some Week 1 stuff.”

“That happens in Week 1,” Burrow said. “Those things happen when the quarterback doesn’t perform in training camp. That was obviously something I would have liked to have done, but no excuses. It’s, obviously, not very good today. We got to do better.”

3. Defense did its part

The defense kept Cincinnati in the game, holding Cleveland to a field goal until the final minutes of the first half when Deshaun Watson ran in a 13-yard touchdown to make it a 10-0 lead going into halftime.

Cincinnati also got two turnovers the offense didn’t do anything with after Germaine Pratt forced a fumble that Chidobe Awuzie recovered and Dax Hill recorded his first NFL interception. The first led to a punt and the second a missed field goal.

Nick Chubb got going in the second half while the Bengals were likely feeling worn down by the amount of time the defense was on the field, and Cleveland was able to take advantage to extend the gap. Chubb amassed 106 yards on the ground. The Browns got two more field goals from Dustin Hopkins and a game-sealing touchdown pass from Watson to Harrison Bryant in the fourth quarter after a turnover on downs deep in Bengals territory.

4. Awuzie still working in

Awuzie started the game, but his workload was managed by rotating him with rookie second-round draft pick DJ Turner, who had a solid training camp and preseason to earn the role of the fourth cornerback.

The game marked Awuzie’s first since tearing his ACL at Cleveland last Halloween, and he only had about three weeks of full participation in practice while the Bengals tried to protect him by easing him back in. That could be the case early this season, and in the meantime, Turner is getting valuable experience.

Turner started the second half, and Watson targeted him on third down but Turner had good coverage to force a three-and-out. Two series later, Turner tackled Elijah Moore on third down to force the Browns to settle for a field goal. He finished with two tackles. Awuzie, who also is in a contract year, had three tackles and the fumble recovery.

5. Robbins gets tested

Rookie punter Brad Robbins had a tall task in his NFL debut, getting work on every drive the first half through heavy rain and finishing with 10 punts for an average of 40.9 yards per punt.

Robbins struggled early, including a low one down the middle for just 41 yards in the first half, but he ended up with a redemptive moment when backed into his own endzone. He boomed that one for 54 yards to reset the field a bit, and he finished with two inside the 20-yard line and one touchback.

It’s too early to read much into Robbins’ first game considering the difficult conditions. He had a hard time handling the snap on at least one of his punts, where the ball slipped out of his hands, and that led to a rushed kick. The ball is heavier in the rain, as well.

Browns punter Corey Bojorquez averaged 47.3 yards on his seven punts.

SUNDAY’S GAME

Ravens at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS, 1530, 102.7, 104.7

CLEVELAND — It was like Christmas morning. Or, as Browns linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. called it this week, "the first day of school."

Turns out, it wasn't just how the day started for the Browns as they opened the season against the Cincinnati Bengals. It ended in much the same way as they rolled over the two-time AFC North champions 24-3 to win their second consecutive season opener.

The Browns turned the 100th Battle of Ohio into a rain-soaked party, extending their win streak in season openers to two in a row. They also continued to dominate the Bengals, especially quarterback Joe Burrow, over the last three-plus seasons.

Browns extend winning ways in opener, over Bengals QB Joe Burrow
The win improved the Browns to 3-21-1 in season opener, including their second in a row after last year's win at the Carolina Panthers. The won for the first time since 2004 in a home season opener, improving them to 2-15-1 in those games.

They have also now won six out of the last seven against the Bengals, including five out of six when Burrow has started.

Burrow finished the game 14-of-31 passing for 82 yards and a 52.2 passer rating. He was sacked twice and eventually was pulled with 5:15 remaining.

Here's how the game played out.

Deshaun Watson to Harrison Bryant to bury Bengals in 21-point deficit
Myles Garrett's big sack didn't go unrewarded. Three plays later, Deshaun Watson hit Harrison Bryant for a 3-yard touchdown to open up a three-score lead.

Watson then added the 2-point conversion to make it 24-3 Browns with 9:11 remaining.


Myles Garrett haunts Joe Burrow yet again
Myles Garrett hadn't had a sack with just over 11 minutes left in the game. He made sure to change that quickly,

Garrett sacked Burrow on a fourth-and-6 play from the Bengals 31 with 10:27 remaining. It was his eighth career sack of Burrow and his 12th career sack of a Cincinnati quarterback.

Dustin Hopkins makes it 3-for-3 in Cleveland Browns debut
Dustin Hopkins made fast friends with his new fanbase with 11:29 remaining in the fourth quarter. The veteran kicker made his third field goal of the game, a 43-yard field goal to extend the Browns lead to 16-3 over the Bengals.

Hopkins made his first three field goals with the Browns.

Grant Delpit heads to locker room to start 4th quarter
Browns safety Grant Delpit spent a couple of minutes on the ground after the final play of the third quarter. However, he jogged off the field and headed to the bench initially.

Delpit, though, eventually went to the locker room with the trainers. There's no official word on his status.

End 3rd quarter: Cleveland Browns 13, Cincinnati Bengals 3
The Browns took a 13-3 lead over the Bengals into the final 15 minutes of regulation. The Bengals were facing a fourth down coming out of the break.

The Browns held a 281-143 edge in total yards through three.

Nick Chubb goes to work to set up Dustin Hopkins field goal
The Browns went to Nick Chubb after Evan McPherson's missed field goal. Starting from their own 41, they needed five plays to get to the Cincinnati 21.

Chubb carried the ball five times for 38 yards on the drive, giving him 91 yards on 16 carries at that point. Deshaun Watson added a 13-yard run as well.

When the drive bogged down, Dustin Hopkins came on to make a 34-yard field goal. The kick, his second of the game, made it 13-3 Browns with 2:21 remaining in the third.

Grant Delpit pass break-up leads to missed Bengals field goal
Dax Hill's interception of Deshaun Watson ultimately did no damage. The Bengals' Evan McPherson missed a 51-yard field goal wide right to preserve a 10-3 Browns lead with 6:53 left in the third quarter.

The big play in the possession was a third-and-5 pass breakup by Browns safety Grant Delpit, who knocked the ball away from Tee Higgins on a deep go route to force the field goal try.

Deshaun Watson pass ends up in Bengals' Dax Hill's hands
The first big mistake by Deshaun Watson came to end what appeared to be a promising Browns possession on their second drive of the half. Watson wanted to throw deep to Marquise Goodwin, but he was covered.

So instead, Watson rolled left and threw it, only Cincinnati defensive lineman Zach Carter got a finger on the pass. That allowed it to flutter to Bengals safety Dax Hill for the interception, which he returned 20 yards to midfield.

Pass interference flag helps Bengals extend field goal drive
Evan McPherson's 42-yard field goal with 11:44 left in the third quarter allowed the Bengals to get on the board. The kick cut the Browns lead to 10-3.

The field goal was possible thanks to an obvious pass interference flag on Browns cornerback Denzel Ward on a third-and-6 pass from midfield. Ward clearly grabs the jersey of Ja'Marr Chase as he runs by him trying to make the play, drawing the flag.

The Browns defense, though, didn't let it be more than three points. Both Za'Darius Smith and Myles Garrett hit Burrow as he delivered throws, then the Bengals quarterback hit a short 8-yard pass to Irv Smith on third down to lead to the field goal.

Halftime: Cleveland Browns 10, Cincinnati Bengals 0
The Browns hold a 10-0 halftime lead over the Bengals, and they have a 200-97 advantage in total yards, a 122-63 rushing edge and a 78-34 passing advantage.

Deshaun Watson was 10-of-20 passing for 85 yards passing with a 61.5 passer rating. He did have 32 yards and a touchdown on four carries.

Joe Burrow was 6-of-14 passing for 36 yards and a 50.3 passer rating for Cincinnati.

Deshaun Watson gets nose bloodied, gives Browns 10-0 lead
A play after Elijah Moore's electric 19-yard run to open the Browns' final first-half possession, Deshaun Watson was sandwiched between Cincinnati's D.J. Reader and Sam Hubbard as he threw an incomplete from the Bengals 48. Watson was slow to get up, and TV shots showed him with a possible bloody nose.

That only seemed to make Watson mad. He was 3-for-4 for 29 yards passing after the hit.

Not only that, but Watson capped the drive with a 13-yard touchdown run to give the Browns a 10-0 lead with 17 seconds remaining in the half. He bounced to the outside to his left and got to the end zone before he could be taken down.

Nick Chubb remains option No. 1 for Browns as Deshaun Watson looks for rhythm
Deshaun Watson talked during a preseason game in Philadelphia about how the Browns offense was now running through him. In the first half of the first game that mattered, it looked like option No. 1 was still No. 24, Nick Chubb.

Chubb had 10 carries for 57 yards over the Browns' first six possessions. He also had four catches on four targets for 21 yards.

That production helped offset a first half in which Watson was 7-of-14 passing for 56 yards. The quarterback did have 19 yards on three rushing attempts.

Joe Mixon kick-starts Bengals drive, but it bogs down in Browns territory
The Bengals' fifth possession was the best one to that point, moving from their own 21 to the Browns 38. Two Joe Mixon runs netting 34 yards was the secret to the start.

It didn't get Cincinnati any points, though. A deep shot on third down by Burrow to Tee Higgins was tightly defended by cornerback Denzel Ward and fell incomplete, leading to a Cincinnati punt.

Right tackle Jack Conklin carted off with knee injury
Browns right tackle Jack Conklin was carted off the field after his left leg crumpled underneath him on the Browns' second-and-11 incompletion on their first full second-quarter possession. Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson crashed into Conklin's leg on the play.

Conklin is a year removed from a season-ending patellar tendon injury in November 2021. Rookie Dawand Jones replaced Conklin at right tackle.

The Browns went three-and-out on the possession.

Cincinnati Bengals, Joe Burrow struggle with Browns pressure early
The Browns only had one sack over the Bengals first four offensive possessions. However, they consistently made Joe Burrow uncomfortable in the pocket, throwing off the timing.

Burrow was 4-of-10 passing for 25 yards over those four possessions.

Dustin Hopkins kicks Cleveland Browns into the lead
The Browns' kicking woes may not be solved, but they at least were fixed enough to give them a 3-0 lead two plays into the second quarter. Dustin Hopkins' first career field goal both for the Browns and in Cleveland Browns Stadium was a 42-yarder to the west end of the stadium.

The kick gave the Browns a 3-0 lead with 14:15 remaining in the second quarter. It capped a seven-play, 33-yard drive.

End 1st quarter: Browns and Bengals scoreless
The Browns and Bengals ended the first quarter in a 0-0 tie. The Bengals had two three-and-outs, while the Browns had two drives into Cincinnati territory.

Amari Cooper injured on first catch of the season
Amari Cooper made a 20-yard catch at the Bengals 24. However, his legs came out from underneath him as he was trying to turn and pick up yards after the catch.

Cooper sustained an injury on the slip, and spent a couple of minutes being looked at by trainers near the Browns huddle. He did walk off on his own.

Cooper would return on the next Browns possession.

Nick Chubb take over on second Browns possession, but Jerome Ford fumbles
Nick Chubb showed why he's still the Browns' most consistent offensive weapon when he helped them move from their own 41 to the Bengals 21 on their second possession. He had 23 yards on three rushes, including a 17-yarder.

Chubb also had a nice 10-yard gain on the second play of the drive on a screen pass. It was an early sign of getting the back involved on a rainy day,

Jerome Ford, though, came in on second-and-5 from the Cincinnati 21 and gave it all away. The second-year pro coughed up the ball after a 6-yard run when he was hit by linebacker Logan Wilson, with cornerback Chidobe Awuzie recovering.

Cleveland Browns starting offense around QB Deshaun Watson
The Browns started their first offensive possession at their own 14 with 12:05 left in the first quarter. Deshaun Watson managed to scramble for a 12-yard gain to get a first down, but the Bengals picked up a pair of sacks to force them to punt from their own 28 after six plays.

They went with this starting lineup:

QB: Deshaun Watson
RB: Nick Chubb
WR: Amari Cooper
WR: Elijah Moore (Motioned into a tailback spot prior to first snap)
WR: Donovan People-Jones
TE: David Njoku
LT: Jedrick Wills Jr.

Cleveland Browns open the season on defense
The Browns won the toss and deferred to the second half. They managed to get pressure on Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow on the first play of their six-play opening drive, which Ogbo Okoronkwo ended with a sack of Burrow on third-and-5 from the Cleveland 47.

They started on defense with the following lineup:

LDE: Za'Darius Smith
LDT: Dalvin Tomlinson
RDT: Jordan Elliott
RDE: Myles Garrett
LB: Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah
LB: Anthony Walker Jr.
NB: Martin Emerson Jr.

Safety Juan Thornhill will not play against Bengals due to calf injury
Juan Thornhill tried to give it a go. The Browns safety, who missed practice on Thursday and Friday due to a right calf injury, spent a significant time about three hours prior to kickoff going through a intense workout trying to get the clearance to play.

It wasn't enough. Thornhill, who was listed as questionable, is inactive for Sunday's game.

Thornhill had general manager Andrew Berry, head coach Kevin Stefanski, defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz and safeties coach Ephraim Banda observing at least parts of his pregame workout. He signed a three-year $21 million contract in March after four years with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Rodney McLeod will now start at free safety for the Browns. Grant Delpit remains in the starting lineup at strong safety.

Siaki Ika, Isaiah McGuire among Browns inactive players against Bengals
The rest of the Browns inactive list includes four rookies: cornerback Kahlef Hailassie, center Luke Wypler, defensive end Isaiah McGuire and defensive tackle Siaki Ika.

The Bengals inactives include defensive end Joseph Ossai, who had been ruled out Friday with an ankle injury. Also inactive for Cincinnati: halfback Chase Brown, cornerback DJ Ivey, center Trey Hill and offensive tackle Jackson Carman.

After Ja'Marr Chase almost referred to the Cleveland Browns as Elves, the Browns defense had an answer on Sunday, only giving up 39 yards to Chase and 3 points to the Bengals as they won the battle of I-71, 24-3.

"It feels like a regular game to me," said Chase according to cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot. "It don't feel no different. It's just the hooping and hollering about the Cleveland Browns. I was about to call them the elves, but yeah."

Myles Garrett had a response in his media availability on Friday.


Garrett along with the rest of the Browns defense, perhaps with help of some Elven magic and a little help from Mother Nature, dominated the Bengals offense. Garrett's sack on Joe Burrow on 4th-and-4 closed out the game for the Browns.


Burrow struggled with the rain, often pouring sideways throughout the game. He tried going barehanded as well as putting on a glove, but he never found any rhythm. Some of that was because the Browns pass rush was consistently generating pressure throughout the game and putting body blows on Burrow.

Chase did lead the Bengals in receiving, but it was just five receptions for 39 yards on eight targets. Burrow finished the day 14 of 31 for 82 yards, but the team's passing drops to 67 yards due to two sacks.


Chase did mention his comments in his postgame press conference.


Tee Higgins fared no better as he was completely erased from the game; 0 catches on 8 targets. Unquestionably, the rain and wind played a role in the Bengals performance, as it also hindered the Deshaun Watson-led Browns offense, but the Browns defense contested everything.


The only open looks the Bengals were getting in the game were underneath passes that the Browns rallied to and tackled, often short of the sticks. Along with only surrendering 143 total yards on 14 drives, the Bengals only had 6 first downs compared to 10 punts.

For the Bengals, this is likely a temporary setback, but the Browns needed this type of performance from their defense. They needed every stop to ensure the victory, but they needed to justify all of the investments they've made to the roster and coaching staff this year . It's an added bonus that it comes against their instate rival who happens to be the reigning AFC North division champions. 


Burrow's record against the Browns drops to 1-5 over his career. That's the most losses he has to a single team in his career and the Browns defense in particular has had success against him. Burrow will have to wait until the final game of the season for a chance at revenge, which may come with significant playoff implications.

The Browns defense looked great against one of the better offenses in the league and the team gets a sizable pelt on their wall. They look as advertised, but will need to keep it up for the Browns to continue to have success this year and compete for the AFC North.

An opening day loss to the Browns is certainly not the start that Bengals fans were anticipating. 

Every offseason comes with excitement about the team. From what they could be this year, how they've improved, and how the new additions are going to hit the ground running. Similar to last season, it felt as if all of the excitement died in the first few quarters. A putrid offensive performance and disgusting special teams play led to another opening day let down for the Bengals. Still, let's look at this game through clear eyes and discuss some of the good and the bad from the wet, miserable day.


Weather Problems

The weather was an issue for the Bengals in this game. That's not an excuse for how poorly they played offensively, but it will be hard to replicate these conditions going forward. Joe Burrow couldn't figure out the rain and how he needs to adjust to grip the football. It was a contributing factor in his worst game as a pro. 

You can really throw out a lot of this game due to the weather, but one thing that's worth looking at moving forward is how this team adapts to their star quarterback having a rough day. 

Yesterday, it felt as if the Bengals offense had no answer for their quarterback having an off day and that's tough. Every stadium in the AFC North is outdoors. They only have one game in a dome this season. When the weather is an issue, this team needs to be able to have a workable offense. Joe Mixon averaged roughly five yards per carry before the Bengals pulled Burrow, but it was inconsistent. They only had a 23% success rate while running the ball, which is in the bottom 10% of the NFL. 

The run game sparked a drive (that the Bengals squandered), but it was not enough to be the engine of the offense. There was a lot of talk about how they're going to be able to implement the shotgun offense as often this season, but it didn't work that way in Week 1.

Joe Burrow's Worst Performance
USATSI_21391593_168390307_lowres
Related to the weather, Burrow had the worst performance he's had in stripes. Finishing with just 82 passing yards is unacceptable in any conditions. He didn't turn the ball over and was only sacked twice, but he was hit 10 times on 33 drop backs.

 He couldn't figure out the grip he needed on the ball and was historically inaccurate. Burrow's -0.48 EPA per play and -18.2 Completion Percentage Over Expected are numbers that he may never touch again. 

He looked rusty, he looked unsure of what he was seeing, and he looked rattled as the game went on. I would not expect this going forward, but it's worth noting for the game and why the offense struggled so much. This offense is going to go as Burrow goes and yesterday he was horrendous.

Defensive Stand Outs

The defense was lights out early on. Without any help from the offense, the defense only allowed 13 points over three quarters. They were the reason this game was close for a majority of the contest. 

Germaine Pratt had a fantastic game, as he forced a fumble, had a sack, tied for the team lead in tackles, and made two tackles for a loss. The new safety duo in Nick Scott and Dax Hill looked solid as well. Scott tied for the team lead in tackles and did a good job limiting the Browns explosive opportunities as the deep safety. Hill filled the stat sheet as well with two tackles for loss, a pass breakup, and his first career interception. Trey Hendrickson had a nice day as a pass rusher with one sack and another quarterback hit, while Sam Hubbard and DJ Reader played well against the run. 

Reader also batted a pass and collected a quarterback hit. The defense came out of the gates strong with a very promising performance.


Special Teams Issues
USATSI_21391288_168390307_lowres
The special teams unit was a disaster in the rain. There was a penalty on a punt return, a kick return that was 10 yards short of a touchback, a punter (Brad Robbins) averaging 40 yards per punt, a missed kick and a botched snap. 

This led to six different possessions that started inside of the Bengals 25-yard line. The Browns had four such possessions. Pro Football Reference calculated this difference is special teams as about 8 expected points. It's very difficult to win football games when you're giving up more than a touchdown with your special teams unit.

Cincinnati Bengals coach Zac Taylor had a simple message to his team after its season-opening loss at Cleveland.

“This certainly isn’t the team we’re going to be, and we all understand that,” Taylor said in his post-game press conference when asked what he told the players.


Despite expectations being higher than ever coming off back-to-back AFC Championship appearances, the Bengals struggled out of the gate, falling 24-3 to the Browns on Sunday in the 100th “Battle of Ohio” matchup. An offense that didn’t get any first-team preseason snaps together looked not surprisingly out of sync considering the team had the equivalent of just two weeks of practices with starting quarterback Joe Burrow.

Here are five takeaways from the loss to the Browns.

1. Yet another slow start

ADVERTISING


Burrow hasn’t had a normal training camp yet but his last two were impacted more than his first two in terms of how much throwing he was doing with his receivers, and he looked almost equally as sloppy in both openers in 2022 and 2023.

The fourth-year quarterback missed five weeks because of a right calf injury and although he was physically in a better place than when he came back from an appendectomy last year, he only had a week and a half to get up to speed with his receivers prior to Sunday. It didn’t help the Bengals were facing a defense they’ve struggled with in the past.

Explore
PHOTOS: Bengals vs. Browns
As a result, the Bengals were shut out in the first half, and the offense amassed just 142 yards while Burrow threw for a career-low 82 yards the day after inking a five-year, $275 million extension. He had just 36 yards in the first half, Cincinnati punted on all seven drives before halftime and Burrow completed just 45.2 percent of his passes for the game.


In his post-game press conference, Burrow said his calf was “good enough.”

2. Higgins shut out

Tee Higgins didn’t land a catch despite Burrow throwing to him eight times, and while some of that might have been the effect of Burrow’s accuracy being off, it just seemed like the two of them were not on the same page.

On a couple of occasions, Burrow was looking for Higgins in a certain spot and he wasn’t anywhere near the throw.

Wide receiver Tyler Boyd said Friday that Higgins “got the short end of the stick” not getting a contract extension this summer, so perhaps there is a mental aspect to negotiations hanging over him. Last year, Jessie Bates said he felt like his first half of the season was impacted by added pressure of trying to earn a contract, but Burrow chalked up miscommunications with his receivers to “just some Week 1 stuff.”

“That happens in Week 1,” Burrow said. “Those things happen when the quarterback doesn’t perform in training camp. That was obviously something I would have liked to have done, but no excuses. It’s, obviously, not very good today. We got to do better.”

3. Defense did its part

The defense kept Cincinnati in the game, holding Cleveland to a field goal until the final minutes of the first half when Deshaun Watson ran in a 13-yard touchdown to make it a 10-0 lead going into halftime.

Cincinnati also got two turnovers the offense didn’t do anything with after Germaine Pratt forced a fumble that Chidobe Awuzie recovered and Dax Hill recorded his first NFL interception. The first led to a punt and the second a missed field goal.

Nick Chubb got going in the second half while the Bengals were likely feeling worn down by the amount of time the defense was on the field, and Cleveland was able to take advantage to extend the gap. Chubb amassed 106 yards on the ground. The Browns got two more field goals from Dustin Hopkins and a game-sealing touchdown pass from Watson to Harrison Bryant in the fourth quarter after a turnover on downs deep in Bengals territory.

4. Awuzie still working in

Awuzie started the game, but his workload was managed by rotating him with rookie second-round draft pick DJ Turner, who had a solid training camp and preseason to earn the role of the fourth cornerback.

The game marked Awuzie’s first since tearing his ACL at Cleveland last Halloween, and he only had about three weeks of full participation in practice while the Bengals tried to protect him by easing him back in. That could be the case early this season, and in the meantime, Turner is getting valuable experience.

Turner started the second half, and Watson targeted him on third down but Turner had good coverage to force a three-and-out. Two series later, Turner tackled Elijah Moore on third down to force the Browns to settle for a field goal. He finished with two tackles. Awuzie, who also is in a contract year, had three tackles and the fumble recovery.

5. Robbins gets tested

Rookie punter Brad Robbins had a tall task in his NFL debut, getting work on every drive the first half through heavy rain and finishing with 10 punts for an average of 40.9 yards per punt.

Robbins struggled early, including a low one down the middle for just 41 yards in the first half, but he ended up with a redemptive moment when backed into his own endzone. He boomed that one for 54 yards to reset the field a bit, and he finished with two inside the 20-yard line and one touchback.

It’s too early to read much into Robbins’ first game considering the difficult conditions. He had a hard time handling the snap on at least one of his punts, where the ball slipped out of his hands, and that led to a rushed kick. The ball is heavier in the rain, as well.

Browns punter Corey Bojorquez averaged 47.3 yards on his seven punts.

SUNDAY’S GAME

Ravens at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBS, 1530, 102.7, 104.7

On a night when the New York Jets lost Aaron Rodgers for the season, the Buffalo Bills still gave the New York Jets every chance to stay in the game. 

Four turnovers by Josh Allen breathed life into the Jets on Monday Night Football at MetLife Stadium, and it eventually came back to cost Buffalo. A 65-yard game-winning punt return by Xavier Gipson sealed the Bills' fate as they lost 22-16. 

"We made it pretty hard on ourselves," Bills head coach Sean McDermott said. "When you turn the ball over four times, it's hard to win in this league. You're playing two opponents, the one on the other sideline and yourself, and that's what we did tonight. That's not the right formula to win games in the NFL...We beat ourselves."


Allen was 29 of 41 for 236 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. He also lost a fumble, which led to the go-ahead 30-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein to put New York up 16-13 with 1:51 left in the game. 

It's not hard to argue that Buffalo (0-1) likely coasts to a win if Allen takes care of the ball. The Jets (1-0) couldn't get anything going with Zach Wilson at quarterback outside of a field goal on their first drive of the third quarter. 


USATSI_21399169
Allen's third interception of the game to Jets safety Jordan Whitehead reinvigorated the fans and their offense with a short field. New York finally capitalized when Zach Wilson found Garrett Wilson for an acrobatic five-yard touchdown to tie the game 13-13. 


"You've got to play complementary football," McDermott said. We didn't do that either tonight. We've got to make the adjustments we've got to make and get ourselves ready on a short week."

Without Allen's final two turnovers, Buffalo likely gets a hard-earned divisional win on the back of their defense. Instead, they're already behind in a stacked AFC East.

Buffalo heads home to Highmark Stadium to host the Las Vegas Raiders at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday. 



There aren’t many words for what happened on Monday Night Football between the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets. Most of the team showed up and performed at a high level to start the season on a good note — but the most important piece of the team didn’t. Quarterback Josh Allen displayed shades of his first few years in the league, where he played erratically and took too many chances on throws he shouldn’t have attempted.

It wasn’t just on Allen but a very large portion rests on his awful four-turnover performance in the season opener against a divisional opponent. Nonetheless, it’s a long season and the Bills are onto Week 2 against the Las Vegas Raiders — a game where Allen should absolutely get back on track with a dominant performance.

But first, let’s take a look at ESPN Analytics and its win probability metrics to figure out where things started to go downhill for Buffalo. In classic Bills fashion, they gave up their first lead with just under two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.

First quarter, 3:05 remaining — BUF with a 66.1% win probability

The Bills’ first offensive drive of the season lasted just two and a half minutes and they ran just five plays for 17 yards. Following an injury to Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the Bills took advantage of the low morale and got their first points on the board with a field goal from Tyler Bass. Per usual, the drive was stalled by a penalty and poor pass protection.

Second quarter, 4:43 remaining — BUF with a 74.7% win probability

Allen threw his first interception of the season on their third offensive drive and the Jets were able to put points on the board as a result. In the best drive of the night where Allen looked like himself, the Bills capped off an 11-play, 75-yard drive with a touchdown pass to none other than Stefon Diggs. This featured the dominant and exciting Bills offense we all know and love.

Start of third quarter — BUF with an 83.3% win probability


Leading by 10 at halftime, the win probability metrics heavily favored the Bills here (83.3%). An interception from Jets backup quarterback Zach Wilson at the end of the second quarter allowed Buffalo to get three more points on the board before halftime. But, as the second half started, everything started going downhill for the Bills.

Fourth quarter, 4:55 remaining — BUF with a 54.8% win probability

The Jets kicked a field goal on their first drive of the second half, lessening the deficit to just seven points. Buffalo and especially Allen started to lose any form of consistency or groove and recorded one punt and two interceptions in its first three drives of the second half. Allen’s second interception really cost the Bills, though, because the Jets were able to score a touchdown and tie the game at this point. Normally when we see less than five minutes on the clock and the Bills offense coming onto the field, we feel safe because of Allen — but it was the opposite Monday night. He wasn’t trustworthy at this point in the game and he spiraled even further, fumbling on the first play of the drive following the Jets’ momentous touchdown to tie the game. What’d the Jets do, then? Yeah, they kicked a field goal to take the lead with less than two minutes to go.

Start of overtime — BUF with a 51.7% win probability

Even after the Bills’ epic collapse, the win probability metrics still favored them slightly after tying the game at 16 as the fourth quarter ended. Usually, coin tosses don’t work out in Buffalo’s favor but it did this time. Unfortunately, it didn’t matter because the Bills ran three plays for -2 yards, punted the ball away from their own 23-yard line and, well, you know what happened. Sam Martin’s punt was pretty brutal and the rest of the unit wasn’t on the same page, resulting in a walk-off punt return touchdown.

You have to love the highs and lows of being a Bills fan, am I right? As much as this loss stung and will linger in our minds for the whole season, we’re onto the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 2! Let’s just be happy Bills football is back, alright?

The NFL could not have asked for a more thrilling Monday Night Football opener. The Buffalo Bills would have accepted a less heartbreaking affair.

The Buffalo Bills left MetLife Stadium with a loss to the New York Jets on Monday, 22-16. An overtime punt return from receiver Xavier Gipson ended New York’s night with fireworks.

At 0-1, Buffalo now shares last place in the AFC East with the New England Patriots.


Obviously, Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ injury will steal the headlines, justifiably so. Still, Week 1 was the first dose of real Bills football, giving fans a fresh docket of hope, concern, and unhealthy amount of stress.

There was a lot to learn from Buffalo’s Week 1 loss.

1. Even without edge rusher Von Miller, this pass rush can compete.

It was apparent early and often, and it played a role in Rodgers’ exit. The Bills’ pass rush was facing a questionable opponent: 38-year-old left tackle Duane Brown and right tackle Mekhi Becton. The latter hadn’t earned the starting job until the end of August.


Both tackles struggled mightily, and weren’t helped by the processing of backup quarterback Zach Wilson. It seemed like every other pass attempt ended in Wilson holding the ball too long and getting chased by a Buffalo defender.

Edge rusher Leonard Floyd totaled 1.5 sacks while defensive tackles Jordan Phillips and Ed Oliver had one sack and a half sack, respectively. Greg Rousseau made his presence felt, too, even if it didn’t show up in the box score.


Wilson was clearly uncomfortable in game action nobody saw coming, and Buffalo did their part to make life difficult. If they can continue to apply pressure like they did on Monday, the eventual addition of Miller could render them a legitimate top defense.

2. Josh Allen hasn’t fixed the turnovers, yet.

Regardless of how this game ended, it would have been impossible not to note Allen’s turnovers that stunted a strong defensive performance.

A fourth-quarter fumble gave New York a chance to clinch the game after he mishandled the snap. Prior, safety Jordan Whitehead pulled off a hat trick. He intercepted Allen twice on questionable deep shots, and again at the Jets’ 43-yard line.


Sure, his first interception was a pseudo punt, but when the next play is an 83-yard rush, it becomes a little easier to believe in momentum. Allen’s second toss was more reckless, unleashing on second-and-13.

The turnovers negated an otherwise strong performance and were crucial in keeping the Jets in a game they had little business winning. To some extent, this one is on him.

Allen has proven to be turnover prone, but it’s something Buffalo will live with. Expect him to return to MVP-form next week, even if the interceptions continue to linger.


3. The ancillary weapons are vital to Buffalo’s success.

For all the drama surrounding receiver Stefon Diggs this offseason, he played well in the opener. In total, he registered 10 catches, 102 yards, and a touchdown. An offensive pass interference penalty added a little extra doubt to the Bills’ final drive of regulation, but all in all, he had a strong day.

The Bills can trust him to do his job. Everyone else had the opportunity to earn some confidence on Monday.


Running back James Cook was a nuisance, using his explosiveness to get to the edge consistently. He has solidified his role as the starting running back.

Receiver Gabe Davis had a big 26-yard reception, but recorded just one other reception. No other receiver separated themselves, but fans got a glimpse of how the tight end usage would go down.

Both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox saw plenty of action on Monday. Offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey deployed them creatively, isolating them outside and putting them as the flat receiver in RPOs.


If the run game can keep going and Buffalo’s “11 and a half” personnel continues to find success, it’s only a matter of time before this offense finds itself in a rhythm.

The Bills will look to get their offense in order next week against the Las Vegas Raiders.

The Buffalo Bills opened their 2023 campaign with a disastrous 22-16 loss to the New York Jets. Here is Bills Wire’s analysis and recap of Buffalo’s disappointing performance in East Rutherford:

Game recap

Buffalo Bills defensive end Leonard Floyd (56) USAT

The much-hyped opening game between AFC East divisional foes saw a shocking shift of emotions throughout the entire evening. The Bills offense opened with a disappointing five-play drive, culminating in a punt.

On New York’s first drive of the season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers left with an injury after only four plays. The veteran quarterback was sacked by Leonard Floyd, and the Jets’ massive offseason addition was off the field in a matter of moments.

The Bills offense finally made some progress, only to be denied just outside of the red zone.  Buffalo rattled off an 11-play drive that stalled out at the Jets 22-yard line. Jets defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers sacked Allen, putting the Bills in a tough third-down position. In the end, Allen couldn’t lead his team further, leading to a Tyler Bass 40-yard field goal.

The roller coaster ride continued for Buffalo, as Allen forced a deep pass downfield. Jordan Whitehead intercepted his first of three Allen passes on the evening. Still, Buffalo’s defense kept things under control, forcing the Jets to settle for a field goal to tie the game.

Buffalo’s offense looked like they were about the turn the corner, as Allen led the Bills offense on an 11-play, 75-yard drive. Allen rolled out to his right and delivered a pass to Stefon Diggs in the corner of the end zone to give Buffalo a 10-3 lead.

The Bills defense would once again make a big play, with Matt Milano intercepting Zach Wilson. However, Buffalo’s offense could only muster a field goal in response. Even so, the Bills entered halftime with a 10-point lead.

The second half was a time of horrors for Allen. He turned the ball over three more times, with two more interceptions by Whitehead and a lost fumble.

The Jets methodically worked their way back into the game. New York wideout Garrett Wilson made a fantastic juggling catch to give the Jets their first touchdown of the season.

While Buffalo’s offense stalled, the Jets continued to grind out yards on the ground. Breece Hall and Delvin Cook slowly carved up the Bills defense. While the New York offense was far from dynamic, it did enough to keep the Jets in it.

The Jets took their first lead of the game just after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. The Jets made several conservative play calls to put them in position to take a three-point lead.

Down 16-13, Buffalo’s offense showed a spark of life.

The unit was forced to play quickly and decisively. Allen, despite his struggles throughout the second half, pulled it together to drive the Bills offense into field goal range.

Bass upheld his end of the bargain with the dramatics, narrowly making a 49-yard game-tying field. The kick clanged off the goal post and cleared the bar.

Buffalo took possession of the ball in overtime but proceeded to go three-and-out. In improbable fashion, Jets punt returner Xavier Gipson returned Sam Martin’s low line-drive punt 65 yards to the end zone for the victory.

Allen’s four turnovers effectively stunted any sort of meaningful progress for the offense. Allen threw three egregious interceptions. He followed those with a mess of a fumble, one which put the Jets in an ideal position to tie the game.
The Jets found success on the ground. New York ran for 172 yards on 28 carries. Hall was stellar in his return to the field, rushing 10 times for 127 yards. Hall had a sensational 86-yard scamper that completely flipped the field for New York.
Buffalo’s defense kept Wilson under wraps. Wilson threw for only 140 yards on a 14-of-21 passing day. Even so, Wilson managed the game and put New York in a position to win. His lone turnover led to only three points by Buffalo’s offense.
The Jets defense, for the second consecutive year, gave Buffalo’s offense fits. Outside of Diggs and a few plays by James Cook, the Buffalo offense looked sluggish. The offense line had issues with protecting Allen. In turn, Allen forced several passes, which became turnovers.
Sam Martin’s final punt lacked the hang time to allow the coverage unit to effectively bottle up Gipson. The unit looked out of sorts as Gipson weaved his way for the game-winning score.

It’s not exciting to give game balls following a loss. However, there were a few standouts:

Stefon Diggs–10 catches, 102 yards, 1 touchdown reception
Tyler Bass–three-for-three on field goals, including the 49-yarder to tie the game with two seconds remaining in regulation
Leonard Floyd–three tackles, 1.5 sacks

What happened?

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) USAT

Buffalo’s offense never seemed quite comfortable throughout the game. The Bills started with a quick passing attack to neutralize the Jets defensive attack. However, this advantage largely went away as the Jets put more pressure on the Bills offense line.

Allen’s turnovers were alarming. He was pressing throughout the game and reverted back to some hero ball tendencies. The interceptions were horrendous decisions, almost as if nothing would go wrong once the ball left Allen’s hands.

It became a snowball effect. The line struggled; Allen struggled; the team struggled.

Some blame falls on Ken Dorsey as well. The playcalling did not fit what would most effectively deal with the Jets superior front four. The lack of a run game in addition to the inability to consistently get the ball into the skill players’ hands is quite a problem that needs to be solved in four days.


What's next?

The Buffalo Bills return to Orchard Park for their first home game of the season against the Las Vegas Raiders. The Raiders (1-0) squeaked out a 17-16 victory over the Denver Broncos in Week 1. Wide receiver Jakobi Meyers caught two touchdown passes in the victory.

As a fan of the Denver Broncos and NFL football who has been watching his team play pathetic losing football for 7 years and counting, I have just about seen it all. Big losses, close losses, inept coaching, bad officiating, and poor play come with the territory when your team is permeated with a losing culture.

This game had it all in drips and drabs and it is maddening to watch when you care about your team.

That being said, I’m trying not to pick up the jaded attitude I left at the end of last season and bring it with me into this season after just one game.

Because it is Just. One. Game.

And there were positives to be sure. Let’s talk about them a bit and look forward to week 2 and hopefully some winning football for a change.

Defense

I entered the season thinking the biggest question mark for this team was our defense under Vance Joseph. I just can’t shake the feeling that as a young coach and coordinator, he’s been handed the keys to sweet rides fairly consistently which has led to his success.

What I mean by this is that I question just how much he brings to a defense that already knows how to play good defense. Just like the Broncos’ loss, I’ll leave this as a question mark and hope I see better from his defenses in the coming weeks.


From a high level, the big obvious problem was the complete lack of pass rush. Coach Payton talked about how quickly Garoppolo gets rid of the ball as an excuse, but that is all that is…an excuse. There were many key plays where the Las Vegas Raiders needed to hold the ball in order to move the chains and the pass rush was just non-existent.

A great example of this was the key play of the game in the last drive with the Raiders at 3rd and 7. The Broncos brought the blitz with 2 extra rushers and it had zero impact on the play. The Raiders offense just yawned and completed the conversion to ice the game.

The other thing worth paying attention to at a high level is the cornerback situation. Our guys behind Surtain were woefully inept in this game and Mathis honestly should have been benched in the game. I can only assume that because the guy behind him is Essang Bassey, that wasn’t an option because it would not likely have improved the situation.

Front 7
Let’s start with the positives: The run defense was killing it. I know Broncos Country is shell-shocked when it comes to Josh Jacobs, but the “Broncos Killer” ended the day with a paltry 2.5 ypc. That’s a win up front for the big guys.

As I already mentioned, the pass rush was severely lacking. One factor in this was the referee’s absolute refusal to call holding on the Raiders. I saw at least 3 holds in the first 3 quarters that were obvious calls. I stopped looking for it at halftime because it was apparent that the refs were not going to call it.

Alex Singleton made me a fan with his coverage in the end zone in the mess of a drive the Raiders had in the 3rd quarter. He forced the miss that ended up being an interception by Kareem Jackson. He led the defense being in on 8 tackles and had one of the few of the game’s quarterback hits by a Bronco.

Zach Allen had one of the only big TFLs in the game in the 4th quarter getting Jacobs down for a big loss. He also had a quarterback hit in the game and showed Broncos country that we’ve got a plus player on the interior line.


One guy who seemed to be missing as a new Broncos player was Frank Clark. As a pass rush specialist and a veteran, I was honestly amazed at just how missing he was in this game. The only time I did notice him was when he committed a neutral zone infraction to give the Raiders a first down on a 3rd and 3. The drive didn’t end in points but keep in mind the impact on field position and TOP.

Secondary
Damarri Mathis looked like a guy out of his depth. He gave up an easy TD and a wide-open pass for 10+ which was followed by another 10+ pass. He also committed a pass interference penalty in the end zone. He gave up another TD on a slant in the 4th quarter where he did absolutely nothing to try to defend the pass. The dude got taken to school by the Raiders in every way and was easily one of the top 3 reasons the Broncos lost this game.

Now that that is out of the way, Patrick Surtain II is the truth at cornerback, plain and simple. In the 2nd half, McDaniels called a flea-flicker play that Surtain absolutely smothered with perfect coverage. He ended the game with a whopping 3 pass defenses (for those of you who don’t look at stats, this is not common…commonly good players have 1 or 2 in a game). Surtain did get a really bad pass interference call to extend a Raider drive. He should have known better than to put both hands on the #1 WR of the other team when Bill Vinovich is on the field.

Broncos Shop 2.0
Essang Bassey’s contribution to the game started (and ended?) with a late hit that was about the dumbest penalty I saw on the day. You have to play smarter than that to win football games. I wonder how long it will take for this Broncos team to start learning that lesson.

Kareem Jackson honestly amazes me. The guy is just a damned good football player every year. He’s aging like fine wine and still killing it on the football field. He had one of the teams pass defenses and an interception on the day adding to his already lengthy legacy in the NFL.

Offense
The offense was a tale of two halves. The first half had me excited and hopeful for this season. The second half had me practicing mindfulness and deep breathing due to ghosts of losing seasons past.

But the overall outlook is positive in my No Bull mind. The team ran the ball very well with a 4.3 ypc average. They also had success in the passing game with 2 TDs in the end zone and an overall 108 passer rating for our quarterback.

The team needs wide receivers to get healthy or young guns to step up enough to start being impactful for the team. With their thin depth there, big plays were hard to find in this game which made it easy for the opponent to key in on shorter passes and bog down the offense in the second half.

Quarterbacks

Russell Wilson with pass blocking in front of him is deadly in the red zone. He worked the back of the end zone for easy scores with supremely accurate throws for scores twice. I loved seeing the offense give him easy half-field reads and space to create with on designed roll-outs.

I think this was a very good first game for the restoration of Russell Wilson. He looked sharp, positive, and executed the plays well for Sean Payton.

Line

I think Mike McGlinchey was the biggest signing for the Broncos in free agency and his performance in this game helped solidify that opinion for me. He was against one of the toughest assignments in the NFL in Max Crosby and held it down very well.

Lloyd Cushenberry III stuck out to me once again as the line’s weak link. He had multiple plays where he got powered over or out-maneuvered. I honestly think that this is a “Rome wasn’t built in a day” situation. I find it highly likely that we’ll be seeing a new name at center next season.

Running Backs

Javonte Williams is back and I’m here for it. He ran with power, confidence, and great vision on the day. One of his best plays saw him bounce to the outside after getting piled up by the Raiders defense to turn a nothing gain into about 8 yards.

Samaje Perine has the talent to make guys miss in the open field as well as running the ball up the middle. I think his game compliments our #1 back perfectly with him bringing a little more elusiveness and burst to the field.

Receivers

Courtland Sutton is once again being expected to win one-on-one matchups and he looked great on the day with that challenge. He got one of the two TDs on the day and looked very sharp and fast with soft hands for his QB.

Who said that Russell Wilson doesn’t throw to tight ends? They caught 7 passes on the day between Adam Trautman and Greg Dulcich.


Lil’Jordan Humphrey ran a gorgeous crossing route at the back of the end zone. He made himself an easy target for Wilson keeping a step ahead of his defender.

The big thing missing from the receivers is more plays downfield. The Broncos never forced the defense to do anything other than play zone and keep everything in front of them and the team didn’t do enough to punish them for it.

Special Teams
That’s a shaky way for a kicker to start the season. I get the missed field goal by Wil Lutz…I’m not even mad about that one iota. What bugs me is the missed extra point. That kept us out of overtime.

Final Thoughts
We lost a close game and I’m never too upset about that until it becomes a trend. Every season is a new start and each game is worth exactly one win or one loss.

The Broncos are a rebuilding team trying to learn how to win. It will take time and consistently good coaching along with good learning by the players for them to get it figured out. Next week will be another step in the process and hopefully, we’ll see different results from our team.

Offense — B-
It didn’t take long at all in the 2023 season for Russell Wilson to get cookin’. In fact, he completed 17 of 19 throws for 125 yards and a pair of first-half touchdowns for the Broncos on Sunday against Las Vegas. While he and Denver didn’t pile up yardage, Wilson played efficiently, completed passes to 11 different receivers and looked in command of head coach Sean Payton’s offense. Raiders star Maxx Crosby made an impact, but Denver chipped and helped enough to limit him to one sack. The run game didn’t get going until the second half, though Javonte Williams looked fast and powerful in his return from a major knee injury last year. Denver, though, went three-and-out after Las Vegas took a 17-16 lead, and at the end of the day put only 16 on the board. That’s not going to win many games.

Defense — C-
This unit expects to be one of the NFL’s elite groups under Vance Joseph. It held the line for much of the afternoon against Jimmy Garoppolo and the Raiders, but a six-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that gave Las Vegas a 17-16 lead with 6:34 to play was far too easy. The Raiders targeted cornerback Damarri Mathis throughout the game and could do so because Denver generated very little pass rush. When the Broncos needed to get home against Garoppolo, they didn’t. That negated a staunch performance against the run in which the Raiders managed 61 yards (2.1 per attempt). The pass rush going forward is going to be a question. Denver’s not getting Baron Browning back for a few weeks at least. Where’s the pressure going to come from?

Not as pretty: Denver’s four early penalties and 10 overall, including a couple of really costly ones. A sloppy effort in the opener in that department. Overall, the staff had a plan to keep Wilson in rhythm and navigate playing without top receiver Jerry Jeudy. Payton coached the game like he knew it would be a low-possession slugfest, and that’s just what materialized. This team needs something beyond good management to forget how to give away close games.

DENVER -- — Change the coaches and switch the quarterbacks, the Raiders still own the Broncos.

Jimmy Garoppolo threw two touchdown passes to fellow newcomer Jakobi Meyers in their Las Vegas debut and the Raiders spoiled Sean Payton's first game as Denver's coach with a 17-16 win over the Broncos on Sunday.

“It ain't got to be pretty, you've just got to get it done,” Davante Adams said as he walked off the field with Garoppolo after the Raiders stretched their winning streak over their AFC West rivals to seven games despite the absence of star pass rusher Chandler Jones, who's involved in a feud with the front office.

That skid hurts even worse to some Broncos fans than the 15-game losing streak against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. Kansas City has owned the AFC West for seven years while the Raiders and Broncos have spent that time taking turns as the dregs of the division.

Garoppolo, who came to Las Vegas after six seasons in San Francisco, and Meyers, who joined the Raiders after four seasons in New England, connected 10 times for 81 yards, including touchdowns of 3 and 6 yards.

The second, which erased Denver's 16-10 lead with 6:34 remaining, followed an end zone interception by Broncos safety Kareem Jackson.

“ That's Jimmy, he's got great mental toughness. Love his grit. Love his toughness,” Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said.

After taking the lead, the Raiders held Denver to its only three-and-out and Garoppolo got the ball back with about five minutes left and never gave it back.

Jackson was whistled for a 15-yard penalty on the drive when he hit Meyers in the head with an elbow after a key catch, sending him to the sideline. That infraction helped the Raiders run out the clock.

“I thought we only had to make one more play than they did," McDaniels said, “and that's what we did.”

Payton returned to the sideline after a year's sabbatical in the Fox broadcast booth in large part to revive Russell Wilson's career after the quarterback's worst season. Wilson looked much better than he did last year with Nathaniel Hackett at the helm, completing 27 of 34 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns without an interception.

Wilson only threw for 52 yards in the second half, however, after tight end Greg Dulcich (knee) left and the Raiders ramped up their pass rush.

Payton's special teams were the biggest problem for Denver.

There was a costly hold that negated one return, a botched onside kick to open the game and two big misses from Wil Lutz, Payton's reliable kicker in New Orleans whom he reacquired in a trade with the Saints last month.

“My job is to make points,” said Lutz, who was wide right on both the PAT and a 55-yard field goal attempt, “and to lose a game by one and I leave four points on the board, I didn’t do my job.”

“He'll bounce back,” Payton said.

Lutz's dismal day brought renewed scrutiny on Payton's decision to jettison veteran kicker Brandon McManus last spring. McManus quickly signed with Jacksonville and was 5 for 5 on PATs and field goals Sunday in the Jaguars' 31-21 win over the Colts.

Lutz was good from 24 yards out to push Denver's lead to 16-10 midway through the fourth quarter. That capped a 16-play, 75-yard drive that followed Jackson's end-zone interception off Alex Singleton's tip.

“The pick was a terrible, stupid decision,” said Garoppolo, who completed 20 of 26 passes for 200 yards without a sack. “Just got to take the points there, throw it away when nothing’s there. But you know, I thought the mental toughness kicked in and guys stuck with it. They believed in me, so I appreciate them for that.”

Garoppolo rewarded that faith by driving the Raiders 75 yards in six plays with the payoff coming on Meyers' 6-yard TD grab and Daniel Carlson's PAT proved the final margin.

WILSON'S REBOUND

Wilson threw two 5-yard touchdown passes in the first half. The first was to wide receiver Lil'Jordan Humphrey, another of Payton's former Saints players, on Denver's first drive. That marked the first time since 2008 at Oakland that Denver scored a touchdown on its first drive of the season.

Wilson's 5-yard strike to Courtland Sutton with 18 seconds left in the second quarter gave Denver a 13-10 halftime lead. Wilson retreated to the locker room having completed 17 of 19 passes — with one of the misses being a clock-stopping spike — for 125 yards.

“I feel great," Wilson said. “The only thing that's disappointing is we didn't come up with a win tonight.”


Javonte Williams led Denver with 52 yards on 13 rushes in his first game since blowing out his left knee at Las Vegas almost a year ago.

INJURIES

Raiders: D Tre'von Moehrig left in the third quarter with an injured thumb.

enver, CO. — Football returned to the Mile High City on Sunday, but it resulted in the Denver Broncos losing their seventh straight game to the Las Vegas Raiders, 17-16.

For the first time in a very long time, competitive and competent professional football graced the gridiron of Empower Field at Mile High, but it wasn’t good enough. After the Kansas City Chiefs lost on Thursday Night Football, the Broncos failed to capitalize, dropping their first divisional game of the 2023 season as the Raiders now sit atop the AFC West after Week 1.

The Broncos have failed to beat the Raiders since the team moved to Las Vegas from Oakland following the 2019 season. 10 of the last 14 games between these teams have been decided by a single digit, adding salt to an open wound.

But what did we learn from the Broncos' debut under Sean Payton? Is it going to be the same old story, or did we see anything in Week 1 that hints toward a brighter outcome this year? 

Let's review my three takeaways coming out of the season opener. 

Will the Real Russell Wilson Please Stand Up?
The destiny of the Broncos' season is dependent on the level of success that Wilson and Payton share. You win and lose as a team, so the saying goes, but Sunday's loss was not Wilson’s fault. The 12th-year pro finished 27-for-34 with 177 passing yards and two touchdowns with a QB rating of 108.0.

Wilson played a confident, calm, and collected style of football in front of a rowdy and excited sea of orange. His footwork has significantly improved from last season and was even better than I observed a couple of weeks ago in training camp, specifically on his three-step drops from under center and during handoffs. Wilson has clearly embraced the rapid level of decision-making this offense demands, which is predicated on being fast-paced and unpredictable.

But where Russ looked the most like his old Super Bowl-winning self was during his off-script plays that led to first downs and scoring plays. Throughout the game, Wilson improvised with off-platform throws and scrambles that bought receivers and tight ends the time to get open. 

Instead of the ineffective and stale level of play that Broncos Country became distraught over last season, Wilson led his unit up and down the field with poise and grit, proving he’s one of the guys and a trusted leader on this team.


Based on what I've seen at training camp, I’ve been adamant in both print and on the airwaves that Wilson isn’t washed and has plenty of winning football left in him despite this ugly loss to open this season. So far, so good.

The QB has seemingly embraced Russ the football player rather than Russ the rockstar. The veteran isn’t the catastrophe that will spell disaster for this team after all, but the Broncos had better improve in other areas.

Williams tore three ligaments in his knee against the Raiders last year in Week 4, leaving many to wonder whether he’d ever return to form. It’s one thing to look good in training camp with veteran days and teammates who are protecting offensive playmakers from physical contact, but it’s a whole different conversation to see Williams pounding the rock in Week 1 without any hesitation, mimicking his powerful and aggressive signature style before last year’s injury.


The 23-year-old running back reintroduced himself to the NFL as he rushed for 52 yards on 13 attempts, averaging 4.0 yards per carry against the Raiders. He was also targeted as a receiver six times, catching four passes for five yards. While those stats are hardly indicative of winning football, it was relieving to know that he's healthy.

Not only did Williams’ legs appear to hold up against multiple defenders twisting and lunging at them, but ‘Pookie’ embraced contact, breaking multiple tackles and continually churning the pile and moving the chains. Samaje Perine spelled Williams as RB2 with eight rushes for 41 yards, while preseason darling Jaleel McLaughlin saw a few snaps as the Broncos officially debuted their new-look running back room.


There’s clearly some learning and adjusting still happening with the Broncos' offensive line, tight ends, and backs. As the offense continues to gain momentum and familiarity with each other, trust and instinctual decision-making will lead to efficiency and dynamic playmaking. 

While I can appreciate the level of efficiency that Wilson and the Broncos' offense utilized in the passing game, I want to see more carries for Williams in the run game. He’s just now seeing what it’s like to run behind his new O-line. With Williams running defenders over and putting them on their backs in pass-pro sets, he’s screaming to get fed the football more.


Instead of trying to boost a Wilson renaissance with one throw after another, I want the Broncos to be a run-first, pass-second offense. Maybe it’s just the first game of the season, and the medical staff wanted to ease Williams into it and leave plenty of tread on the tires, but it felt like passing the football was the priority. 

Of the Broncos' 22 total first downs, only five of them were by way of rushing, while total yards accumulated included 94 yards on the ground and 166 yards through the air.


I’m tired of wondering ‘what happens if’ when it comes to the Broncos' starting running back getting injured. Any player at any given position or time is susceptible to both minor and severe injuries, and living in fear is no way to get by, let alone play professional football. 

If Williams says he’s good to rock and roll, then give him the rock more and let him rumble.

Underwhelming Homecoming for Vance Joseph 
When Payton announced that he hired Joseph as defensive coordinator last February, Broncos Country was hardly excited.


This was the same Joseph who served as Broncos head coach, stumbled to an 11-21 record, and was fired after Year 2. But they say decent enough folks deserve second chances, and this time around, ‘VJ’ looks comfortable and excited to be leading Denver’s defense instead of the entire franchise. 

In Week 1, Joseph’s defensive troops surrendered 17 points to the Raiders in a one-point loss. In addition to the close final score, it was odd to see both teams finish with the same number of first downs. How the two rivals got there was also exactly the same. 


With each team totaling 22 first downs, the Broncos and Raiders each had five rushing first downs, 11 passing first downs, and six by way of penalties. Meanwhile, both squads went 5-of-11 on third down, and each scored two total touchdowns. 

Bizarre. 

It felt like there was a 'bend but don’t break' element to the Broncos' defense on Sunday. However, the number of first downs and yards surrendered was acceptable if it meant negating touchdowns or limiting field goals. 


I can appreciate that Joseph had his troops in positions to keep fighting in a competitive game, but where were the Broncos' pass rushers? Denver failed to sack Raiders quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, and he was only hit three times.

The lack of pressure allowed Jimmy G to operate freely for the majority of the game as he slung the football to wide receiver Jakobi Meyers, who finished with nine receptions for 81 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Meanwhile, Vegas' star wideout Davante Adams was limited to six receptions for 66 yards and was under constant duress from Patrick Surtain II.


Payton chose Denver because the Broncos had the right ownership group, a franchise QB, and a talented defense. If that last part is true, Joseph should have some success with this group as his expertise lies in the secondary, dating back to his Colorado Buffaloes days. 

It was nice to see that Joseph's defense was prepared and physical in terms of its level of play and the talent on display. But the Broncos need to see a dramatically improved level of pressure on the QB if this team is going to have a chance at winning football in the AFC West. 


Adjustments also need to be made during the game when younger players are mismatched and being exploited by veteran QBs with playoff experience. Improving the sloppy penalties and self-inflicted wounds — from veterans like Kareem Jackson and Justin Simmons — is a must.

In a close game that could’ve gone either way, the Broncos found themselves on the short end of the stick this week. Losing feels bad, plain and simple.


Instead of wallowing in self-pity, I’m interested to see if this Broncos squad responds to early adversity. Will the Broncos run from it or face it head-on? 

DENVER (AP) — If you’re going to excoriate your predecessor over the mess you were hired to clean up, it’s best to outperform the guy you replaced.

Sean Payton didn’t deliver enough enhancements in his Denver debut Sunday to justify calling out Nathaniel Hackett like he did in the summer.

During a passionate defense of quarterback Russell Wilson, who’s coming off the worst season of his career, Payton accused Hackett and his staff in Denver of doing “one of the worst coaching jobs in the history of the NFL” in 2022.

The Broncos expect a full dose of Josh Jacobs when the Raiders visit to open the season
Hackett, now the Jets’ offensive coordinator, owned up to his failures as a first-time head coach in Denver but suggested Payton broke an unwritten code among coaches to not publicly criticize one another.

Payton’s stinging critique of Hackett’s performance in a USA Today article is sure to provide some extra juice to the Jets’ Week 5 visit to Denver next month, even with Aaron Rodgers’ left Achilles tendon snapping just four snaps into his Jets debut Monday night, taking some luster off the league’s biggest storyline this season.

With his criticism of Hackett, Payton also put himself on the hook to deliver a better product in Denver — and fast.

While Wilson looked a lot more like his vintage Seattle self while running Payton’s offense, the Broncos’ 17-16 loss at home to the Raiders on Sunday was the exact score by which Hackett lost his head coaching debut at Seattle last season.

Hackett infamously settled for a 64-yard field goal attempt by Brandon McManus, a head-scratching decision that backfired and sent the Broncos on a season-long tailspin that cost Hackett his job after 15 games.

Payton didn’t even get the chance to try a last-second field goal Sunday because his defense, which produced zero sacks and committed a half dozen penalties, made Jimmy Garoppolo look like Tom Brady in the fourth quarter.

A Denver offense that averaged 11 plays and more than 6 minutes per drive produced its only three-and-out after falling behind and never got the ball back.

The Broncos’ special teams was worst of all, with a botched onside kick to start the game, a crucial holding call negating a big early return and a dismal debut from Wil Lutz, the reliable kicker Payton had in New Orleans whom he acquired from the Saints two week ago for a late-round draft pick.

Lutz missed his first extra point as a Bronco and was also wide right on a 55-yard field goal attempt, leaving four points on the board in a one-point loss on the same day Brandon McManus, whom Payton curiously cut loose in May, made all five of his kicks for the Jaguars’ in their win at Indianapolis.

Another decision, to trade tight end Albert Okwuegbunam to the Eagles on cut-down day, drew renewed scrutiny Sunday when Greg Dulcich pulled a hamstring on the opening drive of the second half and didn’t return.

Combined with the absence of top receiver Jerry Jeudy (hamstring), Dulcich’s departure left the Broncos without any downfield threats and Wilson was forced to dink and dunk his way through a 52-yard second half.

The Broncos did average 2.7 points per possession, a great figure if you’re looking at the usual 10 to 12 drives teams get in a typical game.

Denver had just six drives Sunday — six! — and the Broncos ran but three offensive plays over the final 8:54 of the game, including a third-down catch 3 yards shy of the sticks. That three-and-out was sandwiched around Garoppolo’s 6-yard TD strike to Jakobi Meyers and his 8-yard scramble on third-and-7 that iced the Raiders’ seventh straight win over their rivals.

A lack of pressure (zero sacks) and a lack of discipline (10 penalties) also doomed Denver, especially safety Kareem Jackson’s 15-yarder for a helmet hit on Meyers on Las Vegas’ final drive.

Despite all that, there were certainly signs of progress under Payton, including this: the fans didn’t have to resort to counting down the play clock as they mockingly did in Hackett’s home debut last year when he had so much trouble getting the plays in on time. General manger George Paton brought Jerry Rosburg out of retirement the next day to take over the game management duties and then promoted him to interim head coach following Hackett’s Dec. 26 ouster at 4-11.

Many of the same issues that dogged the Broncos under Hackett showed up under Payton, including too many flags, a paucity of explosive plays and not enough pressure on the passer.

The Broncos were the NFL’s biggest spenders in free agency this offseason, signing more than a dozen players to contracts totaling a whopping $242,647,500. That’s only slightly more than the $242,588,236 they gave Wilson a year ago with a five-year contract extension that kicks in after this season.

The ownership that traded a first-round pick to New Orleans for the right to sign Payton to a five-year deal that pays him in the neighborhood of $18 million a year also put a $100 million facelift on their stadium.

Most of that money went toward the gigantic new videoboard that’s 70% larger than the old one and among the biggest in the NFL but which only magnified the many mistakes the Broncos made under their new head coach in the opener.

Week 1 Takeaways from Browns Defense: Grant Delpit Dominated
The Cleveland Browns defense enjoyed a dominant debut led by new defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. There were players like Grant Delpit that stood out as well as some trends worth watching.

Cleveland Browns
CLEVELAND BROWNS
The Cleveland Browns defense had an outstanding performance to kick off the season and helped deliver a lopsided victory against the Cincinnati Bengals. Much of what the Browns did on that side of the ball was expected, but defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz did provide some answers to unanswered questions.

The defensive line was expected to be a force for the Browns and from the first snap of the game, they delivered. Za'Darius Smith and Myles Garrett terrorized Joe Burrow throughout the game and the Browns controlled the line of scrimmage, limiting the Bengals running game. Shelby Harris and Dalvin Tomlinson showed why they were such important additions.


Schwartz moved players all over the defensive line, most notably Garrett who played a handful of snaps basically as a linebacker over the center. The depth the Browns have built on their front allows Schwartz to move Garrett all over the place without fear.

Whether Garrett was off the ball or on, the Browns peppered in their 50 front throughout the game and the Bengals had no answer for it. The Browns coverage was effective enough that Burrow often just threw the ball away harmlessly.


The opponent they were playing certainly was a factor, but the Browns defense wants to use three safeties. Even without Juan Thornhill, who missed the game with a calf injury, Ronnie Hickman was on the field as a safety, playing deep over the top. The Browns used Grant Delpit as a nickel linebacker at points.

Speaking of Delpit, he played perhaps the best game of his career. He did not miss. Delpit played all three safety spots as well as linebacker and did everything right. He came downhill to make a number of key tackles, including one for loss and timed up a blitz from safety depth that caused a Burrow incompletion. Delpit's angles both in pursuit and in coverage were on point and he made the biggest play of the game.


Down 10-3 and driving in Browns territory, the Bengals were on the Browns 33 facing 3rd-and-5. With Tee Higgins lined up in the slot against Delpit in man coverage, Burrow tried to hit him on the slot fade. Delpit with his eyes on Higgins played it perfectly, punching the ball away. If the Bengals hit that play, they perhaps score and tie the game. Instead, they missed a field goal and were effectively taken out of the game from that point.

If this is an indication of the level Delpit is going to play this year, he's going to have his best season. When Thornhill is back, expect to see those two along with Rodney McLeod on the field a decent amount.


Browns corners played well. Save for an early rub route that enabled Ja'Marr Chase to get a 12-yard reception, they contested every throw down the field. Martin Emerson Jr. ran two routes better than Bengal receivers, in position to intercept both.

The speed of the Browns defense consistently stood out. They rally to the ball, rarely asking any one player to make tackles and Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah flew around. He had a couple of nice plays in the backfield that had nothing to do with making tackles. On a couple occasions, he was able to dent a would-be puller and halt the running back's progress allowing his teammates to rally to the ball.


The depth on this defense allows Schwartz a ton of flexibility. In this game, they limited their linebacker use in favor of more defensive linemen and defensive backs. That's the strength of their team and they leaned into it whenever possible.

Against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week two, a team that likes to run multiple tight end sets and wants to pound the football, the Browns may utilize more of their linebackers. Whether it's a gameplan or situationally within a game, the Browns can change up their lineup to give themselves the best possible matchups, which makes them difficult to out-personnel.

The Cleveland Browns started off the 2023 season with a big-time Week 1 win, as they defeated Joe Burrow and the rival Cincinnati Bengals, 24-3. Burrow is now 1-5 against the Browns, and 0-3 against Cleveland on the road. 

This was the Browns' first Week 1 home victory since 2004, when Jeff Garcia was quarterbacking. This matchup was sloppy with the amount of rain that fell in the city of Cleveland on Sunday, and while both teams had to battle the elements, it was the Browns who did a better job at managing the wet conditions. 

Deshaun Watson completed 16 of 29 passes for 154 yards, one touchdown and one interception, and also rushed for 45 yards and a touchdown. Nick Chubb was effective on the ground as well, with 106 yards on 18 carries. The real story for Cleveland, however, was the defense. Jim Schwartz's front seven made Burrow miserable for all of 60 minutes, fueling a key divisional win for the Browns. 

Burrow completed 14 of 31 passes for just 82 yards. He was pulled from the game with under six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Burrow's No. 1 wideout, Ja'Marr Chase, caught five passes for 39 yards, and Joe Mixon rushed for 56 yards on 13 carries. 

Let's take a look at what went down in Cleveland on Sunday. 

Why the Browns won
The Browns offense was very solid given the weather, but this win comes thanks to the Browns defense. Burrow was hit on his first dropback of the afternoon, which was just a sign of things to come. Cleveland held Cincinnati to 2.6 yards per play and just six first downs while the Bengals went 2 of 15 on third downs. It was destruction from beginning to end. 

The pass rush was unrelenting, the secondary consistently made plays on Cincy's wideouts and the third-down defense was elite. If this is the kind of defense the Browns are going to play all year, then we are going to see the kind of dramatic improvement fans are hoping for. 

We would be remiss if we completely ignored new Browns kicker Dustin Hopkins, who was perfect in his first game with new team despite the rain. He hit all three of his field goal attempts with a long of 43, and nailed his one extra point attempt. 

Why the Bengals lost
The Bengals offense was nowhere to be found on Sunday. It recorded just 142 yards of total offense, while Burrow even tried wearing a glove at one point because of the wet conditions. 

In Week 1 last year, Burrow accounted for five turnovers. Still, you could argue this was the worst game of his career. He recorded career worsts in completion percentage (45.2%), passing yards (82), yards per attempt (2.6) and tied his career worst in team points (3). Burrow is now 1-5 vs. the Browns, and has been sacked 20 times in those matchups. There's no reason to panic in Cincinnati, but this one was ugly. 

Turning point
Down 13 points with 10 minutes remaining in the game, the Bengals had to get something going. A 13-point deficit in this weather felt like much more, so Cincinnati elected to go for it on fourth-and-4 from its own 31-yard line. That's when Myles Garrett stepped up.


Play of the game
The rain limited our explosive moments a bit, but this play was a fun. The Browns traded for former New York Jets wideout Elijah Moore this offseason, and he actually lined up at running back a couple times on Sunday. On this handoff, he ran all the way over to the right, and then reversed field to pick up a first down. 

In all, it was a 19-yard rush that sparked Cleveland's first touchdown drive of the game. 


What's next
Next week, the Bengals return to Cincinnati to host another division rival in the Baltimore Ravens, who defeated the Houston Texans on Sunday. As for the Browns, they hit the road to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on "Monday Night Football." Kenny Pickett and Co. were blown out by the San Francisco 49ers, 30-7. 



The Cincinnati Bengals face the Cleveland Browns in Week 1 of the 2023 NFL season. Cincinnati will have quarterback Joe Burrow back after he missed the preseason due to a calf strain.

Burrow also signed his extension with the team on Saturday, which made him the highest-paid player in NFL history.

The Athletic’s instant analysis:

A rusty start to the Bengals season
A little rust was expected. Issues dealing with an annoying, consistent rain make sense. An uphill slog against a defense that has always given them trouble was noted. Even with all those built-in excuses, what happened to the Cincinnati offense on Sunday was stunning. This was an all-time stinker for a Bengals offense that looked like one that spent all of camp without its starting quarterback. Burrow’s previous career low for passing yards in a game was 148. Cincinnati managed only six first downs.

This wasn’t just about missed passes. The Bengals were sloppy in basic execution. They had two delay-of-game penalties, an illegal formation, missed communication on hot reads, free runners off the edge and every other way a team can error. The question next is how much of this was an accumulation of calves and contracts and how much of it is a real issue of long-term concern. — Dehner

Burrow couldn’t find a rhythm with Higgins
Maybe the most surprising element of the offensive ineptitude was the inability for Burrow to connect with Tee Higgins. He targeted his star eight times without a single reception. Twice,it appeared Higgins ran a different route than Burrow expected. Multiple times, they could not take advantage of one-on-one coverage. The thought was these guys could pick up without much practice together and immediately snap into shape. For Higgins, in particular, that was not the case and an ugly start to his contract year. — Dehner

Browns paint defensive masterpiece in dominant win over Joe Burrow and Bengals

Bengals special teams couldn’t help
The Bengals special teams didn’t help matters in the least, leaving the team fighting poor field position all day. Punter Brad Robbins was called into duty often and struggled with short punts and an untimely touchback. Rookie Charlie Jones didn’t offer much as a punt returner and Evan McPherson, after hitting every kick this preseason, missed from 51 yards. One of those days. — Dehner

The Browns needed this win
This was one the Browns had to have. Burrow had no timing with his receivers and rarely had any time to throw. The Browns should have been up more than 10-0 at halftime, but their scoring drive late in the first half was an important one. Deshaun Watson scored on a designed quarterback run, and on a day when Watson was pretty bad as a passer, the Browns still were able to utilize Watson’s athletic ability. In the big picture, it’s a game the Browns absolutely needed to win, and they delivered accordingly.

Browns will need Deshaun Watson's arm, but his legs and a great defense were key on Sunday

Highlight of the game

Key stat
This was the 100th meeting between these two AFC North rivals. The Browns have won nine of the last 11 meetings against the Bengals.

Browns dominate Bengals, 24-3
Coined the ‘Battle of Ohio,’ clashes between the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals have always been tempestuous.

However, on Sunday, the 100th encounter between the two franchises was far from that, with the Browns thrashing the Bengals 24-3.

In a game which was dominated by both defenses, Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson ran for one touchdown and threw for another to tight end Harrison Bryant to separate the two teams.

The rest was done by the strong Browns defense which forced Cincinnati to punt 10 times, restricting superstar quarterback Joe Burrow to just 82 passing yards and its No. 1 wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase to 39 receiving yards.

Since Burrow’s arrival in 2020, the Bengals have typically been one of the league’s best offenses but looked out of sorts throughout Sunday’s game, being held to just 142 total yards, the lowest in head coach Zac Taylor’s 57 games in charge.

But Burrow – playing in the first game since injuring his calf in preseason, which he said felt “good enough” – insisted afterwards that “nobody is panicking in here” about the defeat and performance.

“Week 1 doesn’t define anybody’s season,” he said. “Obviously, not very good out there.

“Anybody that watched saw that. But we have been in this spot before and come back stronger and had great years. That’s what we are going to do.”

For the Browns, hopes are high for an improvement on last season’s disappointment. And there were glimpses of positive signs, including Watson’s improvement, running back Nick Chubb running for over 106 yards and the defense’s impressive stoutness.

But at the end of it all, the game showed there is still that fire between the two Ohio teams, with Chase expressing his frustration at losing to the Browns.

Before the clash, Chase had fanned the flames of the rivalry, saying he was going to call Cleveland players “elves” – the team has a mascot, Brownie the Elf.

And after that chastening losss, Chase expressed his frustration at losing to the Browns after all his big talk.

“It’s frustrating because I called they ass elves and we just lost to some elves,” said Chase of the Browns. “So I’m pissed on my part, I’m pissed on that end.

“We got missed opportunities, we didn’t capitalize … and we lost.”



I am going to use a dirty word in this piece, one that many associated with the NFL — inside and outside locker rooms — might not like. The word is luck. It goes by other names — karma, serendipity, variance, etc. — but the thrust is that players and coaches don’t have complete control over everything that happens on the field.

Many have tried to quantify luck. The NFL’s own football operations department identified four key scenarios in which luck plays a large role: dropped interceptions, dropped passes, missed kicks (field goals and extra points) and fumble recoveries, which can depend on which way the football bounces. Julian Ryan from the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective found nearly a decade ago that 55 percent of an NFL team’s turnover-differential during the regular season was because of luck. A highly regarded paper written in part by Michael Lopez, now the senior director of data and analytics for the NFL, found that luck permeates the league, from the small number of games played each season to the parity of the league to the unpredictable nature of the sport itself. So it should come as no surprise there were teams that won in Week 1 that may have been lucky to do so.

NFL best bets for Week 2: These two home underdogs are worth a look

The luckiest team of the week was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 20-17 winners over the Minnesota Vikings. Tampa Bay led for just five minutes 49 seconds of that game and benefited from three turnovers — two fumble recoveries plus an interception. Interceptions are considered to involve luck because they can depend on unpredictable elements such as receiver mistakes, deflections and defensive positioning, along with whether the defensive player actually catches the ball. Those Minnesota mishaps saved 14 points for the Bucs based on the down, distance and field position of each turnover, a huge figure in a three-point game. Minnesota safety Jay Ward also jumped offsides on a Tampa Bay field goal attempt in the third quarter, which gave the Buccaneers a fresh set of downs which they used to score a touchdown. Some might not think of that as luck — Ward made the mistake — but was it a true measure of the talent differential between the two teams?

The Vikings were incredibly lucky last year. Expect a step back.


After adjusting for those and other lucky bounces, we would expect Tampa Bay to lose a game such as that by 12 points rather than win by three. Looked at another way, after stripping out the role luck played in that matchup by adding or subtracting expected points added for the various fluky factors, the Buccaneers should only win a game such as that about 36 percent of the time. Since 2002, when the league expanded to 32 teams, only seven other teams won with a lower expected win rate in the first week of a season. Those seven teams went a combined 1-6 in the Week 2 games following their opening week good fortune.



The Buccaneers were the luckiest team of the week, but the Philadelphia Eagles, considered a Super Bowl contender by many, were a close second. The Eagles intercepted quarterback Mac Jones on the Patriots’ first drive, resulting in a 70-yard pick-six. On the next play from scrimmage, defensive tackle Jordan Davis stripped New England running back Ezekiel Elliott, setting up a four-play touchdown drive that put the Eagles up 16-0 by the end of the first quarter. Philadelphia’s offense would score just nine more points while New England managed 20 points with the benefit of just one turnover, a fumble by quarterback Jalen Hurts that New England recovered but couldn’t convert into points. Adjust for those and other luck factors and Philadelphia would have been expected to win that game just 42 percent of the time.

Other lucky winners from Week 1 included the New Orleans Saints and Detroit Lions.

The Saints, 16-15 winners over the Tennessee Titans, benefited from three interceptions. Detroit got past the Kansas City Chiefs, 21-20, thanks in part to star tight end Travis Kelce and all-pro defensive tackle Chris Jones not being on the field for the Chiefs. Plus, the Chiefs had a chance to win it with two-and-a-half minutes left, but missteps (a dropped pass, an offensive holding penalty and a false start) doomed their comeback. Moments such as that are often more an anomaly than a trend, which is why the Chiefs remain one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl, with far lower odds than the Detroit team that just beat them.

A win is a win, no matter how you spin it. And overall, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played well in their Week 1 20-17 dub against the Minnesota Vikings.

But, of course, one can always dive deeper — and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. Every week, our Bucs Report Card will look into the offense, defense, special teams and coaching to see just how each facet of the team played, what they did great and what they could do better across the board.

The defense was certainly the star of Tampa Bay’s victory, but there was good to be found in every aspect of the team’s performance from start to finish. Take a look at how we graded the Bucs’ first game of the year below:

Offense: C

Brad Rempel-USA TODAY Sports

I’m man enough to admit when I’m wrong. In my studs and duds article, I put Baker Mayfield as a “dud” — and while I do stand by that he had an overall shaky game, that was perhaps not giving him enough credit for how he stepped up in the second half and helped lead the team to victory.

It took a while to get the offense going — a while — but once Mayfield got in a bit more of a rhythm and offensive coordinator Dave Canales shook off the early-game rust, the team’s second half helped secure the victory. Mayfield threw two touchdowns, one over the top to wide receiver Mike Evans another fitted through a window to WR Trey Palmer, and those two TDs ended up being enough to win the game. On top of that, Mayfield got a gritty first down on a scramble late in the fourth quarter and WR Chris Godwin did Chris Godwin things to make a stellar third-down catch and seal the game.

The offensive line did alright in pass protection, not giving up any sacks but forcing Mayfield to move outside of the pocket. Where they were particularly poor was in the run blocking game — a complete lack of push made running the ball difficult, and Tampa Bay only netted 73 yards across the entire day. That’s something they’ll need to address later in the year, among other things.

Overall, there are still numerous parts of the offense that probably don’t bode well for future games if things remain the same. But that second half presented a blueprint for something perhaps greater, so we’ll take the middle ground and give the offense a C grade.


Defense: B+

The defense arguably won this game, and they were mostly stellar. But there is a caveat behind that “mostly.”

The obvious good is the three turnovers credited to the Bucs, though we’d argue that one of them wasn’t particularly to the defense’s credit. The first Bucs turnover came from a botched snap between Minnesota’s center and QB Kirk Cousins, and while it was heads-up of Tampa Bay to get the ball, that was mostly a Vikings-specific error. The other two turnovers, however, were all Tampa Bay — Antoine Winfield made a great play to strip sack and subsequently recover a fumble off Cousins and undrafted rookie Christian Izien made a phenomenal play to force a pick out of WR K.J. Osborn’s hands. Tampa Bay’s wonky run defense from last year doesn’t look to be returning, as it held the Vikings to just 41 yards on the ground.

But all that glitters, as we know, isn’t gold.

The Bucs gave up 328 passing yards, mainly from the connection of Cousins to WR Justin Jefferson, who caught a staggering nine passes for 150 yards. Turnovers prevented those yards from really counting, which is why the defense grades positive, but that may not be the case in future games if other QBs are able to rack up so many yards.

Other highlights, including linebacker Devin White’s best game in Tampa Bay in good long while, give the defense high marks.


Special Teams: B+

Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports

What a relief this was for Bucs fans.

Tampa Bay signed kicker Chase McLaughlin to combat problems with distance that the team had with K Ryan Succop, and boy, did he deliver. McLaughlin hit what would end up being the game-winning score on a monstrous 57-yard field goal and hit every other field goal and extra point that was asked of him. McLaughlin is by far the MVP for special teams this week, and could end up winning the NFC’s Specialist of the Week award for his efforts.

Meanwhile, Deven Thompkins was fine in the return game, returning two kicks for more than 10 yards but getting blasted on a failure to fair catch on one of his punt returns. Jake Camarda has had a bad tendency to outkick punt coverage in preseason, and he continued that regrettable trend on Sunday.


Coaching: A-

We came away particularly impressed with offensive coordinator Dave Canales. He had an understandably rocky start to his first game, but he continuously proved to deliver fresh and exciting schemes and playcalls on Sunday that wouldn’t ever have been seen by Bucs fans in the era of Byron Leftwich. Canales gets a stellar grade from us, and we’re excited to see what else he can do with the offense going forward.

Head coach Todd Bowles also did quite well. He gave the Vikings some tough looks early in the game and dialed up the pressure right when he needed to, contributing to the team’s second turnover off a strip sack. The one thing we take minor points off for is his continued timidness in fourth down scenarios — although a false start penalty gave the team a second chance, Bowles elected to kick instead of going for it on 4th and 1 later in the game. If the Bucs kick that field goal and the rest of the game plays out as is, that decision very well may have cost the Bucs.



Each week after every Bucs game, we’ll take a closer look at the snap count distribution for the Tampa Bay on offense and defense. We’ll assess what we can learn from who played the most and least from the game.

Here’s a closer look at which players received the highest and lowest number of snaps in the Bucs’ 20-17 win on Sunday afternoon on the road against the Vikings in the Week 1 season opener.

Bucs Offense
Bucs Snap Count
Having a new offensive coordinator and system made it exciting for the first game to see how the Bucs would utilize their personnel. The game got off to an unexpected start with backup tight end Ko Kieft getting the first two targets of the game and three in the first half, but it was starting tight end Cade Otton who surprisingly had the most snaps outside of quarterback and the offensive line with 66 of out 68 (97%).

We know the Bucs are going to feature the tight end and plenty of 12 personnel often this season, but for Otton to be an ironman playing that much was interesting right out of the gate. Dave Canales called Otton a Swiss army knife, so clearly he trusts him in any type of formation. Kieft played almost half of the snaps with 32 (47%) while reserve tight end David Wells played in eight plays (12%).

It was also interesting to see how the rest of the wide receiver group would be utilized – outside of Mike Evans and Chris Godwin – after Russell Gage was out for the season. It was very much a by-committee approach, as Trey Palmer accounted for 23 snaps, Deven Thompkins had 18 and Rakim Jarrett was in on six plays.

Of that trio, Palmer had the big moment with the go-ahead touchdown catch, and Thompkins converted a first down on a designed screen pass to him. They both made two receptions. Jarrett did not get a target, but was given a handoff on an end around on the final drive as the Bucs tried to run out the clock.


Tampa Bay only had 173 passing yards and it took the team until late in the second quarter to start finding a rhythm. I’m sure we’ll see a variance in both snap count and production when the group is a little more in-sync. Evans and Godwin ran the show with Evans in for 84 percent of the game and Godwin getting one more snap at 85 percent.

Rachaad White was the feature back on Sunday, as he got in for 54 snaps. He out-snapped the Sean Tucker and Chase Edmonds by a wide margin. Tucker had 10 plays and Edmonds was in for eight. White had the bulk of the work but tallied just 2.3 yards per rushing attempt on 17 carries for 39 yards. On the other hand, Tucker averaged three yards per attempt (five rushes for 15 yards) and Edmonds had four after gaining eight yards on two attempts.

The Bucs did not use any other offensive linemen as an extra blocker or a swing tackle in any of their formations.

Bucs Defense
Bucs Defensive Snap Count

Cornerback Carlton Davis III and newcomer safety Ryan Neal led the defense, playing in all 64 snaps. A lot of the secondary wasn’t far behind with safety Antoine Winfield Jr. and cornerback Jamel Dean each in for 63 plays. Rookie Christian Izien, who had a major impact on the game, clocked in at 36 snaps (56%) as the team’s starting nickel cornerback.

Linebackers Devin White and Lavonte David probably most likely would have played for 100 percent of the snaps, but White missed one snap after grabbing his leg and David missed three snaps after going in concussion protocol and getting tested. David and Vita Vea collided with each other, with David staying down for a bit.

Because of their very brief absence, K.J. Britt took on the role at inside linebacker for two snaps when each of the starters left separately. SirVocea Dennis got in as well playing three snaps. On one of them in particular, Dennis lined up at outside linebacker with both White and David in their traditional spots. This was a little wrinkle thrown in by Todd Bowles.


There was a heavy rotation on the defensive line as the Bucs typically implement. Believe it or not, Logan Hall led all interior defenisve linemen with 40 snaps. Then it was Vea with 38, followed by Mike Greene (30), Greg Gaines (26), Will Gholston (11) and first-round draft pick Calijah Kancey with 11 as well. It would have been interesting to see how much Kancey would’ve ended up playing in this game. He exited in the first half with a calf injury flaring up again.

The Bucs had a good mix in the rotation at outside linebacker, too. Shaq Barrett had no limitations as he played 39 snaps, tying the amount played by Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Interestingly enough, rookie third-round pick YaYa Diaby out-snapped Anthony Nelson by one play, going 26 and 25. It was Nelson, though, who garnered the only sack of the group.

It was Winfield and Nelson that recorded sacks for the Bucs’ defense while Tryon-Shoyinka, Winfield and Izien each had turnovers in the game.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers launched their post-Tom Brady era with a victory that bolsters the team’s belief it can be successful without the seven-time Super Bowl winner.

It wasn’t pretty. However, a 20-17 season-opening win at Minnesota underscored what coach Todd Bowles has been preaching since the day Brady retired last winter: Replacing the winningest player in NFL history is impossible, but there’s still enough talent on a revamped roster to be competitive and win games as the Bucs chase a third consecutive NFC South title.

That includes Baker Mayfield, the former No. 1 overall draft pick of the Cleveland Browns who shrugged off a slow start Sunday to deliver a solid, turnover-free performance in his debut for his fourth team in just over two years.

“The great thing is, when he was having problems, he wasn’t turning it over,” Bowles said, noting Mayfield’s ability to take care of the ball gave a rejuvenated defense a chance to keep the Bucs in the game.

“Baker’s a winner,” Bowles added. “He’s done this before, and the guys love to rally around him.”

Despite being outgained 369 yards to 242, Tampa Bay had three takeaways to undermine a potentially high-scoring day for the Minnesota offense.

Vikings star Justin Jefferson had nine receptions for 150 yards; however, the Bucs kept him out of the end zone.

With Brady leading the way, Tampa Bay won 37 games (including postseason) over the past three years — third-most in the NFL behind the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills.

The 2020 Bucs won the Super Bowl and followed with the first back-to-back division championships in team history in 2021 and 2022.

Most prognosticators expect the Bucs won’t have that kind of success this year.

“I don’t know what it told them. It told us what we knew all along. We can go in and win the ballgame,” the coach said of beating the Vikings on the road. “If I paid attention to it, I would actually have something to say, but I don’t.”

WHAT’S WORKING
The defense, which wasn’t as reliable as usual last season, was resilient against the Vikings. In addition to three takeaways, the unit led by linebackers Devin White and Lavonte David limited Minnesota to 41 yards rushing on 17 attempts. Safety Antoine Winfield Jr. and linebacker Anthony Nelson had sacks, and undrafted rookie nickel back Christian Izien had a goal-line interception.

ADVERTISEMENT


WHAT NEEDS HELP
Tampa Bay had the worst rushing attack in the NFL last season and wasn’t much better against the Vikings, averaging just 2.2 yards per carry and finishing with 73 yards on 33 attempts. If there was an encouraging aspect to the performance, though, it was that the Bucs never stopped trying to run and did manage to produce a couple of crucial first downs late.

“The run doesn’t always have to be pretty. If you can get 33 runs in and keep the defense off the field, it keeps (the opposing defense) out there longer and keeps them off Baker some,” Bowles said. “The amount of carries was just as important as the yardage, if not more important.”

STOCK UP
The opening-game roster included 13 rookies, six of them undrafted free agents. Izien won the nickel back job in training camp and got his first career interception. Sixth-round draft pick Trey Palmer caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Mayfield in the third quarter.

ADVERTISEMENT


STOCK DOWN
Granted it’s early, but a new-look, overhauled offensive line is still struggling to open holes for the running game. Second-year pro Rachaad White, who the Bucs feel is primed for a breakout season, had 17 rushes for 39 yards — 2.3 yards per carry.

INJURIES
Rookie defensive lineman Calijah Kancey left the opener after aggravating a calf injury that sidelined the first-round draft pick most of training camp and the entire preseason. Bowles did not have an update on his status Monday.

KEY NUMBER
ADVERTISEMENT


10 — Winfield’s sack against the Vikings was the 10th of his career, most by a safety in franchise history. It’s also the most in the NFL by a defensive back since Winfield entered the league as a second-round draft pick in 2020.

NEXT STEPS
Dual-threat quarterback Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears visit Raymond James Stadium on Sunday.

he Arizona Cardinals fell to the Washington Commanders in 20-16 fashion yesterday, though there's generally a good feeling the Cardinals took a step in the right direction. 

Arizona arrived as the second-largest underdogs in Week 1 and held a lead for the entire third quarter before seeing it slip away. The Cardinals fought much harder than most expected, though moral victories don't count in the NFL.


Snap counts from yesterday via Pro Football Reference:

Offense
Snap Counts Week 1 O
Every Cardinals OL played 100% of the snaps, a good sign for building continuity moving forward. Rookie Paris Johnson debuted at right tackle and managed to hold his own. 


Josh Dobbs started for Arizona and led the Cardinals to just 210 net yards of offense. His 4.4 yards per attempt was nowhere near good enough to lead his team to victory, and the two fumbles (one coming under center) proved to be costly. They'll need him to take the next step in Week 2.

Rookie WR Michael Wilson made his NFL debut and paced all receivers with 56 snaps on the day. TE Zach Ertz reeled in a massive ten targets while WR Rondale Moore led the Cardinals in receiving yards (33) despite only playing 42 snaps. He caught all three of his targets. 


Jesse Luketa playing fullback wasn't just a joke in the preseason. He registered four snaps on offense. 

James Conner - expected to be the workhorse back in Arizona - heavily out-snapped his backups with 52 plays (83.8% of snaps). RB2 Keaontay Ingram played just seven downs while Emari Demercado had just three.  


Defense
Cardinals D Snap Counts Week 1
Four players played every single snap for Arizona's defense: Budda Baker, Kyzir White, Kei'Trel Clark and Marco Wilson. Jalen Thompson was one snap away from doing the same. 


Arizona did a good job of rotating their defensive front, as 14 different players registered 12 snaps or more on the day. Zaven Collins (59%) and Dennis Gardeck (39.4%) were both impactful when on the field as starters. 

Cameron Thomas scored the lone touchdown of the day on a scoop-and-score towards the end of the first half. He played 26 snaps. 


The Cardinals utilized K'Von Wallace frequently as a third safety, and he impressed in the 50 snaps he played. We weren't sure how Arizona would move forward without Isaiah Simmons in the mix, but they like what they had behind him. 



It's hard to sell moral victories in the NFL - though the Arizona Cardinals shouldn't hang their heads too low after the 20-16 loss against the Washington Commanders. 

The Cardinals - fresh off an offseason that saw the organization begin a massive rebuild - lost several key players from last season in hopes of setting themselves up nicely for the future. While cap space and draft capital is ample for 2024, that doesn't help them this season.


Combine all the above with Kyler Murray's absence as he still continues to rehab from a torn ACL, and you'll see why many believe Arizona will be picking atop the draft order next spring.

Heading into Week 1, the Cardinals were the second-largest underdogs (in terms of point spreads) in the league. A brand new coaching staff featuring first-timers at head coach and both coordinator positions didn't instill confidence in people in and out of the Arizona state boundaries. 


Jonathan Gannon particularly has been the subject of talk through most of the offseason. A mixture of his oddly perceived player interactions/speeches and his (poor) attempt to conceal information for the sake of "competitive advantage" hasn't landed him in the clubhouse of guys such as Mike McDaniel/Sean McVay territory. 

But Gannon didn't take the job in Arizona to be liked - he took it to win. And no matter what outside narrative exists about his team, he's going to coach the Cardinals to the best of his ability.


That's a promise he made at his introductory press conference: His players would play tough and push themselves for 60 minutes. As a coach, that's nearly all you can ask out of your players.

That was the case at FedEx Field, where the Cardinals had most of the football world on standby when they controlled a ball game not many gave them a chance to be in, holding on to the lead for the entire third quarter before ultimately blowing it. 


NFL football is very cut and dry when it comes to results. For the Cardinals, Sunday wasn't acceptable. While Arizona's defense certainly played well enough, quarterback Josh Dobbs and company couldn't hold their end of the bargain on the offensive side of the ball. 

Yet things felt different on Arizona's sideline. Players came out with energy and purpose, something that had been lacking during the downswing of Kliff Kingsbury's tenure in the desert. The Cardinals saw defensive players flying to the football and making plays while their offense looked as balanced as possible given the circumstances they were under. 


As previously stated, Arizona is in the beginning stages of a rebuild. Gannon and his team won't - and shouldn't - be judged from wins and losses in 2023. Rather, it's important to see players respond to his leadership and develop over the course of the season. 

We've heard all about the culture shock under Gannon. Players and coaches have touched on it frequently. Talk is cheap in the NFL, though in a one game sample size, it's clear this team is in a better place than it was the last time they took the field months ago in San Francisco. 


It's unlikely the Cardinals shock the world and make a postseason run. Losses hurt too, even when you're expected to lose. 

Fans in the red sea have to like the direction they're trending in for the future, however. Houses are built one brick at a time, and even in the midst of a loss, another brick was added to the foundation.

Have faith, Cardinals fans. 

Dobbs, Cardinals come up short vs. Commanders
The Arizona Cardinals had two chances to put together a game-winning drive and both times were disappointed by their chosen quarterback.

They fell to the Washington Commanders 20-16 in the first game of the regular season.

Joshua Dobbs got the start for Arizona and serviceable for most of the game. Late in the game, with the Cardinals trailing, 17-16, Dobbs fumbled away a possession when all the team needed to go ahead was a field goal. Kicker Matt Prater had already made three.

The Commanders turned that possession into a field goal that put them up 20-16.

Arizona then got another chance with the ball and needing a touchdown for the win.

Dobbs, who didn't play for the Cardinals during the preseason after being acquired in a trade, finished 21-for-30 for 133 yards. The offense produced just 211 yards while the team was penalized nine times for 122 yards.

Penalties AND turnovers
In the first half, Arizona was hampered by penalties, while the Commanders were hurt by turnovers.

It's been a different story in the second half as the Cardinals have been hurt by both penalties and turnovers.

Both Arizona fumbles were by quarterback Josh Dobbs. The second came with just 4:38 left in the game with the Cardinals trailing by 1. After that play, the Cardinals were also hit with a penalty that put the Commanders inside the Arizona 25.


The Commanders were able to get a field goal off the turnover to put them up by four with 2:25 to play. The Cardinals were only able to move the ball 12 yards on six plays. One of those plays was a sack on Dobbs for a loss of 8 yards.

Scramble puts Washington on top
Quarterback Sam Howell scrambled 6 yards for a touchdown to tie the game and the point after gave the Commanders a 17-16 lead over the Cardinals with 11:48 to play.

The Commanders entered the game as a 7-point favorite.

The Cardinals lone touchdown was scored by the defense. Matt Prate has accounted for the other 9 points with fields of 28-, 54- and 37-yards.

Cardinals end third on down note
Quarterback Josh Dobbs was sacked for a 10-yard loss and fumbled the fall. It was recovered by Washington.

The Commandeers ran one play before the end of the third quarter. Arizona leads 16-10, but Washington is at the Arizona 5.

The fumble was Arizona's first turnover of the game and the season.

Rain, rain
The Cardinals kept the momentum going in the second half. They added a field goal on their first possession to go up 16-10.

Matt Prater kicked it from 37 yards.

The rain has picked up.

The Commanders have kept the ball on the ground with some success in the third quarter.

End of the half
Arizona leads 13-10 at the half.

The Cardinals have been hampered by penalties, while the Commanders have struggled with three turnovers

Let's look at some more stats.

Cardinals quarterback Joshua Dobbs is 8-for-12 for 63 yards. It's first first start for the Cardinals. He has targeted six different receivers with tight ends Zach Ertz (6) and Trey McBride (2) seeing the most balls go their way.

Marquise "Hollywood" Brown leads rushers with 29 yards, which all came on a single play. James Conner has six carries for 22 yards.

Commanders QB Sam Howell is 15-for-24 for 169 yards with an interception and a touchdown. He has been sacked four times and fumbled once.

Defense winning game for Cardinals
The Cardinals lead 13-7 thanks to their defense.

With 55 seconds left in the first half, Dennis Gardeck sacked Commanders quarterback Sam Howell for a 14-yard loss. Howell fumbled and Cameron Thomas scooped the ball up and lunged across the goal line for the go-ahead score.

It was the third turnover forced by the Arizona defense.


Again, the penalties
The first half isn't over. The Arizona Cardinals already have 97 penalty yards.

For comparison, they have 59 passing yards and 59 rushing yards for 118 yards of offense.

Meanwhile, the Commanders have three penalties for 29 yards.

Takeaways giving Cardinals opportunities
Zaven Collins intercepted a pass at the Commanders 37. While the Cardinals weren't able to do much offensively, they didn't lose ground. Matt Prater was able to kick the ball through for a 54-yard field goal.

They moved Arizona to within a point, 7-6.

On the Commanders next possession, the Cardinals got another takeaway.

This time it was a fumbled forced by Victor Dimukeje and recovered by Collins on the Cardinals 16. The fumbled halted a promising drive by the Commanders.

Arizona was not able to get any points off that turnover, but it could be said they kept points off the board for the Commanders since they were already within field goal range.


Cardinals get on the scoreboard
They had a couple shots at a touchdown, but in the end, the Cardinals had to settle for a 28-yard field goal from Matt Prater.

The drive saw quarterback Josh Dobbs complete a 31-yard pass to Rondale Moore. Hollywood Brown gained 29 yards on the ground with a reverse.

The possession was certainly a positive for the Cardinals.

The first quarter ends with the Commanders leading 7-3.

Cardinals penalty problems lead to Commanders TD
The Cardinals have been assessed a pair of penalties — one for a late hit and the other for contact to the head. Both 15-yard penalties came on the same drive.

A third penalty on the drive for pass interference was also assessed against the Cardinals. That was the most costly as it set the Commanders up with a first down on the Cardinals 13.

The three penalties added up to 66 yards.

Two quick plays later, the Commanders were in the end zone. They lead 7-0 with 4:15 left in the first.

One of the officials who threw a flag on the first penalty had to leave the game. He was wrapped up in the play that ended with a late hit along the sideline. The official fell to the ground, where he threw his flag wall seated. He got to his feet, but left the field before the next play.

Cardinals kickoff the season
The Arizona Cardinals literally kicked off the season with the Commanders receiving the ball to start the game.

After picking up a pair of first downs, the Commanders were forced to punt to end their first possession. A penalty against Washington for an illegal block, sets the Cardinals up on their own 17 to start.

There was light rain as the game began. How much of a factor that will be, we shall see.

Josh Dobbs to start for Cardinals?
The Arizona Cardinals had to tip their hand at some point, right?

During warmups, quarterback Josh Dobbs was working with the first team. That indicates that he will get the start against the Commanders. Dobbs did not play during the preseason after being acquired by Arizona.

As the new NFL season got going on Sunday, it was a chance for the Los Angeles Chargers to make an early season statement. They were hosting another playoff team from last season in what was seen as a matchup with potential playoff implications down the line.

The Bolts came in confident that they had ridden themselves of the issues that plagued them last season. But once the clock hit zeros, they were left with a similar feeling of disappointment.


LA dropped the game to the Miami Dolphins, and similar problems were apparent throughout the game. While their offense was good, they did make some mistakes, and the defense couldn’t slow down the Dolphins at all. However, even with all the issues, they had a chance to win the game, making it an even tougher pill to swallow.

Cody Benjamin of CBS Sports provided a letter grade for each NFL team, and the Bolts received a passable B grade despite the loss.

“They could've easily won this game, and Austin Ekeler deserves an "A" for his efforts alone. Joshua Kelley was also efficient for L.A.'s surprisingly dynamic rushing attack. But the red flags were perhaps even more jarring than those of Miami: Herbert committed a critical intentional-grounding penalty with the game on the line”

Per Cody Benjamin of CBSSports.com


The Chargers needed to play a full game to take down Miami. But they beat themselves, which has seemed to be a common theme in years past. And once again, the decisions of head coach Brandon Staley are being called into question.

“The in-game coaching from Brandon Staley remained suspect, and it's debatable at this point if Staley even intends to field a productive defense. The secondary was torched over and over. We just can't fail them for going blow for blow in an offensive showcase.”

The defensive issues of the Bolts are a real cause for concern. They will need to shore things up on that end of the team if they want to have any success this season.

LA had some positives to take away from this game, but they are left with a feeling of frustration from what they could have done here. 



McDaniel Takeaways Day After Dolphins-Chargers Week 1 Game

Head coach Mike McDaniel conducted his traditional day-after-the-game press conference Monday in the aftermath of the Miami Dolphins' 36-34 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium.

Here were the highlights from McDaniel's media session:

-- Isaiah Wynn started at left guard for the Dolphins on Sunday after playing mostly tackle for the New England Patriots, but McDaniel said he saw a skill set when he was coming out of Georgia that made well suited for that position.


-- With Erik Ezukanma lining up in the backfield against the Chargers, McDaniel talked about his unique skill set and why it made sense to unveil it.

-- Asked his favorite completion by Tua in the game, McDaniel talked about "adversity is opportunity" before mentioning the 35-yard touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill in the third quarter, running down the sequence of events that led to it. It started with the interception in the end zone, and the ability to come back from it was part of McDaniel really liked.



-- "Really cool stuff from a developing quarterback that is finding his own footing in how he's playing" is how McDaniel described Tua's 47-yard completion to Hill on the game-winning drive. 


-- The decision to get aggressive with 9 seconds left in the first half after a touchback, and McDaniel said he was confident the pass protection would give Tua and the playmakers a chance to get the ball down the field. "Shame on me if I was going to mail it in." Great job there by Austin Jackson completely stonewalling Joey Bosa on the 22-yard completion to Jaylen Waddle before the DPI that set up the last-second field goal by Jason Sanders.


-- McDaniel said that exact situation had not come up in an analytics meeting.

-- Waddle dealt with some soreness during the game and McDaniel said it's something he'll continue to work through.

-- Tyreek Hill went to the locker room early in the first half, and the issue there dealt with staying hydrated.



Dolphins-Chargers Week 1 Five Biggest Storylines ... And How They Played
The Miami Dolphins kicked off their 2023 season with a 36-34 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium

MIAMI DOLPHINS
The Miami Dolphins kicked off their 36-34 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium in Week 1, and before the game we examined the five biggest stories heading into the matchup.

Now it's time to revisit those to see how they played out.

1. Does the Miami Offense Have a Counter Move?
Before the game: The big story of the 2022 matchup at SoFi Stadium between these teams was how the Chargers defense found a way to stymie the Dolphins’ passing game by jamming wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle at the line of scrimmage, and Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel is too smart a guy to not have come up with counter moves if the Chargers want to employ the same tactics. Whether it’s a bigger emphasis on the running game, quicker throws around the line of scrimmage or featuring a different wide receiver (Braxton Berrios maybe?), what the Dolphins can come up with in terms of offensive game plan will be interesting to watch.


After the game: The Dolphins racked up 536 total yards, Tua Tagovailoa passed for 466 yards and Tyreek Hill had 215 receiving yards, so, yeah, it does look like the Dolphins found the counter move. Or maybe they just executed better than they did last December and the Chargers defense wasn't at the top of its game like it was in that game. Whatever it was, this time it was the Chargers who had no answer for what was happening with this matchup.


2. Fangio’s First Challenge
Before the game: Maybe the biggest reason for the optimism among Dolphins fans and some in the national media is the difference new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio can make with his scheme, the full extent of which we most definitely didn’t see in the preseason. Fangio is well known for disguising what his defense will do, for limiting big plays and for mixing things up. The Chargers presents a clear challenge, but if the Dolphins defense is to take a big step in 2023, it’s got a chance to showcase that potential right from the start.


After the game: This was a mixed bag because the Chargers also had over 400 yards of offense and they did score 34 points while converting 9 of 15 third-down situations. And the run defense that was such a strong point in 2022 really was a bad outing. But the pass defense overall was good, holding Justin Herbert to 228 passing yards. But, above and beyond anything else, the defense came up big when the game was on the line, getting two sacks and pressuring Herbert into an intentional grounding penalty on three of the final four snaps of the game.



3. Tua vs. Herbert, Part 3
Before the game: This will be third matchup between the fifth and sixth overall picks in the 2020 NFL draft, with each quarterback coming away with one victory (though wins and losses are no more a quarterback stat than a wide receiver or offensive lineman stat), and they always will be the focus whenever they face each other because of their draft connection. The winning quarterback in the two matchups was the one with the highest passer rating, though we have yet to have a good old-fashioned shootout. Nobody would complain if that’s what materialized Sunday afternoon.


After the game: We did have a shootout at SoFi Stadium in this game, but Tua was the one deliver the big blows for the Dolphins while Herbert took a back seat to his team's running game. And Tua kept coming up with answer after answer in one of the finest performances of his career. Tua hadn't passed for more than 200 yards in either of his first two matchups against the Chargers, but the 466-yard outing on this day was one for the ages.


4. Lamm on the line
Before the game: Terron Armstead being declared out for this game was the biggest news of the week ahead of the season opener, and it put Kendall Lamm directly in the spotlight. The Dolphins offensive line just flat-out wasn’t good at protecting the passer without Armstead last season, and Lamm probably faces the biggest challenge in this game — not only because of who he’s replacing but because he’s going against the Chargers’ best front seven defender, Joey Bosa.


After the game: As it turned out, the Chargers used Khalil Mack on the right side of their defensive formation, but he didn't perform any better than Bosa did on the other side against Austin Jackson. It was a tremendous by both Dolphins tackles, who each came into the game under a lot of scrutiny, albeit for different reasons. That Tua wasn't sacked at all on 45 pass attempts is pretty indicative of a great job in pass protection, and it's safe to say that Lamm passed this test with flying colors.


5. Wilkins watch
Before the game: Defensive tackle Christian Wilkins will begin the 2023 season without the contract extension he was seeking (to the point of conducting a “hold-in” during training camp), but he’s got a chance every game to make an even more convincing case he deserves the contract he wants. Wilkins had a lot of good games in 2023, but probably none better than the Sunday night game against the Chargers when he offered a dominant prime-time performance. A repeat would be a great way for Wilkins to start his “show me” campaign and would help the Dolphins greatly, and it would be even better if it included a sack or a couple of disruptive plays when Herbert goes back to pass.


After the game: It was hard to find many people on the Dolphins defense, if any, who had memorable performances against the Chargers and that certainly applied to Wilkins. After being dominant in the game last year, Wilkins pretty much was a non-factor in this one. Wilkins ended up being credited with three total tackles, fewer than in any game last season except for the Week 8 victory at Detroit. Wilkins did have one pressure that forced Herbert to scramble out of the pocket, but it simply wasn't the kind of game we saw regularly from Wilkins last season.

The Detroit Lions proved that the hype is real in the Motor City after going into Arrowhead Stadium and taking down the defending Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs. Jared Goff had 253 yards and a TD, but it was rookie Bruce Branch’s pick six that made the difference in the Lions 21-20 win. 

Goff and St. Brown's special connection
The Lions landed the first blow after Dan Campbell went into his bag of tricks early in the game. Detroit faked a punt on 4th and 2 from inside their own 20 and that sparked a touchdown drive that was capped off with a nine yard Amon-Ra St. Brown catch to put the visitors on the board first. 

The Chiefs would respond, led by their reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes, but they were without the heart and soul of their offense, Travis Kelce who hyperextended his knee earlier in the week. Mahomes and KC took a quarter to get the wheels moving but a one yard TD pass to Rashee Rice tied the game up early in the second quarter. 

Mahomes would put the Chiefs in the lead right before the half with a six play, 83 yard drive that ended with a sidearm sling to Blake Bell to give the home side a 14-7 advantage with under a minute to go in the second quarter. 

Mahomes first INT in season opener
The Chiefs seemed to be in control after the late TD to end the first half, and getting possession to start the third quarter. Mahomes had his team moving down the field, but a disastrous night for Kadrius Toney was highlighted by his dropped ball that led to a Bruce Branch pick six to tie the game up early in the third quarter.  

The interception, even though he had nothing to do with it, was Mahomes’ first in a season opening game. He went into Thursday night with 18 TD passes and 0 INTs. The Chiefs offense came to a stand still with no Kelce, and they had to settle for just two Harrison Butker field goals in the second half which put them up 20-14 momentarily. 

On the following possession David Montgomery would lead his team down the field on a long drive that chewed up some clock and eventually put the Lions in the drivers seat. Montgomery punched the ball in from eight yards out in his Detroit debut and put the visitors up 21-20. 

Lions hype is real
The Chiefs had a couple different cracks at tying the game back up, but would go three on out on their next series, and turn it over on downs in four plays on their final series. 

There has been a lot of talk about this Detroit Lions squad after they won 8 of their last 10 to finish off last season. This win will only increase the hype around this team in the Motor City.

Going into Arrowhead and coming out with a win is never an easy things. Sometimes you have to go deep into your playbook to come up with a surprise or two to keep the defending champs on their toes. Dan Campbell went for it on 4th and 2 inside his own 20 in the first quarter, and the Lions would scored the first TD of the game as a result.

The Detroit Lions traveled to Arrowhead Stadium and shocked the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, giving football fans the first big surprise of the 2023 season.

Offensive spotlight: Travis Kelce didn’t play in this game, and as a result, Mahomes was forced to spread the ball around to 11 different pass-catchers, completing  21-of-39 passes for 226 yards and two touchdowns. He also added 45 yards with his legs on six rushes, but he couldn’t win the game alone. Mahomes’ receivers combined for five drops, including three from Kadarius Toney.

Jared Goff connected with Amon-Ra St. Brown for the game's first touchdown, but it took until halfway through the fourth quarter for the offense to get back on the board. Goff led a 75-yard touchdown drive on the back of 51 Josh Reynolds receiving yards and a David Montgomery rushing touchdown to give the Lions a fourth-quarter lead. And that ended up being enough, as the Chiefs’ offense couldn’t get back on track.

Defensive spotlight: Chiefs’ second-year cornerback and 2022 first-round pick Trent McDuffie took over the primary slot role late last year and into the playoffs, which continued tonight. He made a significant impact in that role, forcing a fumble as the Lions were entering the red zone in the second quarter. He also recorded eight tackles — and three defensive stops — grading above 75.0 on first review. 

Rookie spotlight: Lions second-round rookie defensive back Brian Branch manned the slot in his NFL debut and made a significant impact by returning an interception for a touchdown. Branch was targeted three times in coverage and allowed only one reception for 3 yards, allowing an NFL passer rating of 2.8 on throws into his coverage. He added three tackles and two defensive stops. 


The Lions' other rookies all played part-time roles, including Jahmyr Gibbs, who looked electric with the ball in his hands, averaging 6.0 yards per carry on seven attempts while adding two receptions for 18 yards. Tight end Sam LaPorta played 75% of the team’s pass snaps and totaled five receptions on five targets for 39 yards. First-round rookie linebacker Jack Campbell played less than half of the team’s defensive snaps but had a nice pass breakup in coverage against Kadarius Toney.

Winners and Losers From Chiefs' Week 1 Game Against Lions
In the Chiefs' opening loss to the Lions, multiple players stood out for both good and bad reasons alike.
JORDAN FOOTESEP 8, 2023 11:45 AM EDT
In this story:
Kansas City Chiefs
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS
START CONVERSATION
The Kansas City Chiefs' first game of the 2023 campaign is in the books, and it ended in surprising fashion for the reigning Super Bowl champions.

Despite holding a seven-point lead at halftime and being within one score until the very end, Andy Reid's offense couldn't get the job done in the end. A combination of drops, poor coaching decisions and a lack of overall execution led to the loss, and the club with the best championship odds coming into the season is now 0-1 on the year.


ADVERTISING


With that in mind, let's point out some of the Chiefs' biggest winners and losers from the first week of the NFL season.

Winner: Mike Danna
Without Chris Jones or Charles Omenihu on the field for Week 1, many wondered who would step up and provide some sort of pass rush up front for the Chiefs. Now in his fourth year and coming off a five-sack 2022, Mike Danna recorded the only sack in Kansas City's Week 1 loss while also having a swatted pass earlier in the game. The former fifth-round pick resumed right where he left off last season. 


Loser: Kadarius Toney
Multiple game-altering drops resulted in Kadarius Toney being a lock for a spot on this part of the list. Unfortunately for the Chiefs, their proposed top wideout received a decent concentration of opportunities and couldn't make the most of any of them. Patrick Mahomes isn't giving up on the former first-round pick, but he'll have to bounce back in a bit way in order to get back in the winning section. 


Winner: Trent McDuffie
Leading the Chiefs in solo and combined tackles on Thursday, second-year cornerback Trent McDuffie was an active and aggressive player all night long. In addition to crashing downhill and finishing plays, he also forced a fumble in the first half and ended a Lions drive that was headed near the end zone. Steve Spagnuolo's defense was quite solid in Week 1, and McDuffie was a huge reason why. 


Loser: Skyy Moore
Skyy Moore played more snaps than any other Chiefs receiver, yet it was hard to tell at times. Mahomes admittedly did miss him a time or two but when the ball was thrown his way, Moore couldn't convert. This was a massive missed opportunity for the 2022 second-round pick to show that this year will be a new beginning for him. 


Winner: George Karlaftis
Much like Danna, second-year man George Karlaftis played like a true veteran up front against the Lions. His pressure on the Lions' opening drive forced an incompletion, then a swatted pass on the fifth drive effectively ended the first half. The Purdue product was an aware run defender and displayed his classic "always runs hot" motor in the season's opening week. 


Loser: Chiefs running backs
Kansas City toted the ball 23 times for 90 yards in Week 1, although Mahomes, Toney, Moore and Rashee Rice accounted for nine of those rushing attempts and 45 of the yards. Isiah Pacheco and Clyde Edwards-Helaire had the other 45 on 14 total carries, averaging 2.9 and 3.7 yards per rush, respectively, in the game. Pacheco did flash some ability as a receiver but overall, neither primary Chiefs running back managed to stand out in a good way versus Detroit. 


Winner: Rashee Rice
A stat line of three receptions for 29 yards doesn't seem like a winning-level impact, especially when a drop is factored in. With that said, rookie Rashee Rice scored his first NFL touchdown in his debut and also finished with a positive average YAC above expectation according to Next Gen Stats. He showed qualitative traits — juice, ability to turn upfield immediately after snagging a pass, etc. — that will be building blocks for the coming weeks. 


Loser: Andy Reid
Between a rough third down play involving Rice and Blake Bell, a questionable decision on fourth-and-25 and some overall lackluster in-game adjustments, a chunk of the blame for Week 1 should fall on the Chiefs' head coach. Andy Reid took responsibility postgame, which was expected, and he likely won't have many more games like this one in 2023. In a one-point loss, however, not bringing your 'A' game can result in being the difference between winning and losing.



Coming into week 1, expectations for the Colts offense were low and they delivered on that. The offense struggled to move the ball, earning only 18 first downs on 29 series for a Drive Success Rate of 62.1%. That ranks 24th on the week and is a big reason why they only had 14 offensive points on the day. Also, 3 turnovers and another 3 on downs didn’t help.


TEAM TOTALS
Mouseover for definitions: Adj PPD, Team PPG, Off PPG, Yds, P/R%, DSR, yds/srs, Strt Fld, xOPPD, yds/ply, EPA/ply, adj TSR, 1st/ply, Pen 1st/ Yds, 3DC, 3rd ytg, Expl Plys, TO, TOP%

Point-wise, the offense finished 26th (PPD), which is right in line with the 24th-ranked DSR.

The Colts had the 12th-best average field position of any team but could do nothing with it as they managed just 4.1 yards per play (24th). EPA-wise it was even worse, as the abundance of turnovers dragged EPA/ply down to finish 30th.

Even though the team had the 13th lowest yards to gain on 3rd downs, they had the 2nd worst 3rd down conversion rate. That’s a problem.

PASS TOTALS
Mouseover definitions: EPA/db, PSR, Cmp, Att, Yds, TD, Int, Sk, Sk Y, 1st/db, ny/d, cmp %, aDOT, cpoe, YBC, YAC, 20+ #/Yd

By himself, Richardson finished 13th in EPA per dropback, but these numbers include Minshew’s 0 for 2 effort and Deon Jackson’s fumble after the catch, so the team EPA/dropback fell to 19th.

Passing conversions ranked 20th, which is near where the 4.9 Net Yards per dropback finished (17th). If you can’t gain yards or first downs, it’s tough to do well.

Passing depth was short (26th), but as often happens on short passes, YAC made up for it (5th). So, the issue wasn’t completion yardage, but rather the low accuracy (28th CPOE). Based on distance (and other variables) the pass completion rate should have been 8.3% higher. Had that happened, then we would have seen a lot more first downs and likely significantly more points.


RUSH TOTALS
Mouseover definitions: adj RSR, Yds, Car, TD, 1st, Fum Lost, RSR, 1st/c, YPC, 10+ #/Yd, 3rd, 3DC, epa/c,

I’m not gonna sugar-coat it, the run game was awful. The 28th-ranked Adj. Rush Success Rate was driven by the 6th lowest conversion rate and the 31st-ranked Yards per Carry. EPA is no friend to the Colts run game either as the team was dead last in EPA per carry on zero 3rd down conversions.

Last year the Colts had arguably the worst run game and this year is reminiscent of that.

CONCLUSION & LOOK AHEAD
Anthony Richardson’s debut was not great, but it was also not terrible. There were plenty of teams with veteran QBs and worse performances. I can’t say the same for the Colts run game though. It was just plain bad.


Week 2 has the Colts traveling to NRG stadium to take on the Texans. In week 1, Houston’s defense gave up the 9th most Points per Drive against the Ravens. However, they were much better in terms of first downs, ranking 16th in first down conversion rate against. Basically, Baltimore was able to score because they had the 3rd best starting field position and some well-timed explosive plays.

Against the pass, they held Lamar Jackson to negative EPA (16th EPA/d) and no TDs. They also sacked the mobile QB 4 times. Those numbers don’t bode too well for a Colts QB who has only 1 game under his belt.

On the ground, The Ravens fared better, earning the 9th-best aRSR of the week. Perhaps the Colts can see similar success against the Texans' run defense. Or maybe not.

The colts are 1-point favorites at the time of this writing.

Jaguars vs. Colts: Week 1 Snap Count Analysis
Who played the most snaps for the Jaguars vs. the Colts in Week 1?
JOHN SHIPLEYSEP 11, 2023 2:05 PM EDT
While watching a game live can give you one impression of a player's usage, looking at the actual amount of snaps they played compared to their teammates can also give insight into the team's strategy and outlook.

When looking at the snap counts for the Jacksonville Jaguars after their 31-21 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, it is clear to see what kind of plan the Jaguars went into the game with, and what limitations they had from a personnel standpoint.

Who played a lot, and why? Did the snaps mean anything or nothing? We examine below:

Offense (70 snaps)
QB Trevor Lawrence: 70 (100%)
LT Walker Little: 70 (100%)
LG Ben Bartch: 70 (100%)
C Luke Fortner: 70 (100%)
RT Anton Harrison: 70 (100%)
WR Zay Jones: 62 (89%)
WR Calvin Ridley: 57 (81%)
RB Travis Etienne: 56 (80%)
TE Evan Engram: 51 (73%)
WR Christian Kirk: 42 (60%)
RG Brandon Scherff: 37 (53%)
TE Luke Farrell: 33 (47%)
RG Tyler Shatley: 33 (47%)
TE Brenton Strange: 27 (39%)
RB Tank Bigsby: 15 (21%)
WR Jamal Agnew: 3 (4%)
WR Tim Jones: 2 (3%)
RB D'Ernest Johnson: 1 (1%)
OL Blake Hance: 1 (1%)

 Every offensive player not named Cole Van Lanen played on Sunday. D'Ernest Johnson got one carry and Blake Hance came in as an extra blocker on a jumbo package run. 
Jamal Agnew's streak of low snap-count/high volume play continues. Agnew was only on the field for three offensive snaps but still touched the ball twice. 
It was Travis Etienne's backfield. Tank Bigsby got two goal-line touches, but it was the Etienne show for most of Sunday. 
The Jaguars' deployment of the right ends was expected. Evan Engram runs the room, Luke Farrell is the reliable No. 2, and Brenton Strange will get his reps. Engram was the only tight end to see a target. 
It was an odd showing for Christian Kirk, who caught one pass for nine yards on three targets. He played fewer snaps than Zay Jones and Calvin Ridley by a considerable margin and looked like the No. 4 target on Sunday. Part of this is due to how the Colts' defense played, but it is clear Kirk's snap count will decrease this year. 

Defense (72 snaps)

Credit to Yasir Abdullah. He only had five pass-rush snaps but still managed to record a pressure while coming off the bench cold. With that said, K'Lavon Chaisson recorded zero pressures on 14 pass-rush snaps. 
Tre Herndon played every single nickel rep for the Jaguars. He had a productive day as a bltizer, too, recording two pressures and near-sacks. 
The Jaguars had to call on a pair of veteran for defensive line depth after injuries to DaVon Hamilton and Tyler Lacy, with Angelo Blackson and Ross Blacklock combining for 28 snaps.

Colts exit Week 1 disappointed in loss to Jaguars, but encouraged by Anthony Richardson's progress
Richardson completed 24 of 37 passes for 223 yards with a touchdown and an interception, and rushed 10 times for 40 yards with a score in his NFL regular season debut.

Anthony Richardson's best plays in debut vs. Jaguars Week 1
First things first: Anthony Richardson said he's okay.

Richardson exited the Colts' 31-21 Week 1 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars late in the fourth quarter with an apparent injury, but after the game quickly dispelled any concern about his status.

"I'm all right," Richardson said. "More so hurt that we lost than my knee, but other than that, I'm good. I've just got to get to the drawing board and focus on next week."

Richardson, in his NFL regular season debut, completed 24 of 37 passes (65 percent) for 223 yards with a touchdown, an interception and 10 rushing attempts for 40 yards with a score. At 21 years old, he became the youngest quarterback in Colts history to start a game – but, as he has ever since landing in Indianapolis this spring, displayed a wise-beyond-his-years level of poise throughout Sunday's game at Lucas Oil Stadium.

"He played very well and everything that he did, we all knew he was going to do that," wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., who caught Richardson's first career touchdown pass, said. "He's been solid from Day 1 and he's not rattled. The thing about this whole season is we got 16 more (games). It's good that he's not rattled and we're going to go back and watch the film and look at it and see what we need to do to get better and change the way that game ended."

The Colts held a 21-17 lead into the fourth quarter with Richardson playing largely mistake-averse football. But facing a three-point deficit with about five minutes to go, Richardson was intercepted by cornerback Tyson Campbell on second and 10 – and the Jaguars struck for what was an effectively game-sealing touchdown a few plays later when running back Travis Etienne Jr. darted 26 yards into the end zone.

Both head coach Shane Steichen and Richardson took responsibility for the interception after the game.

"I'll take fault for that interception right there," Steichen said. "... It was a Cover 2 deal and we didn't have a great route called there and got to be better there."

Richardson said he thought he could get his throw over the head of Campbell and to tight end Mo Alie-Cox, but he didn't put enough arc on it, allowing the Jaguars' cornerback to snag it.


"That's one of our good plays," Richardson said. "We trust that play a lot, so we called it. I saw the corner, but I just threw it a little too flat, and we weren't trying to attack him the whole game, but I saw that matchup and I thought I could get it over his head, but I threw it a little too flat. But he made a good play. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. We just grow from it."

Steichen was pleased with Richardson's response to that interception, though. He drove the Colts down to the Jaguars' one-yard line before being forced out of the game; while that possession didn't end with points, it still was illustrative of Richardson's poise and even-keel nature.

"You wouldn't have even known he threw an interception," wide receiver Alec Pierce said. "I think he did a good job, even with other people who might have missed a play, he did a good job of just being positive on the sideline and bringing people up. He did kind of mention something to me and was just like next play, let's go. Like, play one play as it goes."

Among the things the Colts and Richardson can build off: The Colts had four completions of 15 or more yards despite the Jaguars frequently showing two-high safety looks to take away deep shots. And Richardson consistently took what was there instead of forcing something down the field, keeping the ball out of harm's way outside of the interception to Campbell.

"I thought overall his performance was good," Steichen said. "There's probably some things we've got to clean up, but I thought he did a nice job."

Where the Colts know they need to improve, then, is in key situations – third down, fourth down and red zone. The Colts converted two of 12 third downs and one of five fourth downs, and turned only one of their three red zone possessions into points (a Richardson touchdown rush).

While the Colts' defense shut Jacksonville down on third down (3/12) and fourth down (1/3), the Jaguars scored touchdowns on all three of their possessions inside the 20. In a 10-point game, those were a major deciding factor.

And those plays were why, ultimately, Richardson was more focused on the sting of losing than any encouragement from his first regular season game.

"We didn't win, so I didn't do good enough," Richardson said. "But first game, first experience, felt good just being out there with my teammates. The energy was good. We've just got to clean some things up, including myself, but it was fun out there just being back out there playing football."

Commanders DE Montez Sweat: 'We're Going To Be Better' Following Week 1 Win
Winning is always good, but Washington Commanders defensive end Montez Sweat knows his team can play better, and he expects them to.

WASHINGTON COMMANDERS
The Washington Commanders got their first win of the season, but many left the game feeling letdown.

There was a disappointed haze that sat over FedEx Field for much of the Commanders' 20-16 win over the Arizona Cardinals, and it was due in large part to the lack of offensive proficiency many expected against arguably the worst team in the NFL.

In the locker room after the game was won you might think Washington lost its first game of the season if you didn't know the score going into it. 


And that prompted questions from media to defensive end Montez Sweat who said he didn't think the team felt upset or disappointed but was merely aware of the work still left to be done.

"We definitely need to get back on the drawing board and get back in the lab," Sweat said after the game. "Just keep building on this, we're going to be better."

Building is always easier when you have a foundation placed, and the Commanders are looking to erect their second win on top of the foundation the first one presented. 

For the defense, many viewed them as the heroes on opening weekend. Sweat, however, says it was not a perfect outing at all.

"At the half, we felt like we let a couple of plays get away from us," Sweat said about his unit. "But at the end of the day, we kind of felt like we knew their game plan...we just wanted to keep on our plan and just get some turnovers."


Washington's defense did exactly that, forcing two of Arizona's three fumbles, and recovering both of them.

It was Sweat who forced each, and he also came up with 1.5 sacks in his first game of the season, in a contract year.

Sweat also came up with five tackles, two for losses, and hit opposing quarterback Josh Dobbs one more time for good measure.


The fifth-year defensive end put his name all over Washington's first win of the season, and if they get some more equations figured out in the lab before heading to Denver this weekend, they'll add a second.

The Washington Commanders' season opener, like the weather that drenched the sell-out crowd at FedExField, was sloppy on both sides of the ball. Passes were dropped, penalties stalled drives, and explosive plays in the first half flipped the field.  

In the end, though, Washington ushered in the new era of the franchise with a win, and as wonky as Week 1 can and has been for other teams, that's ultimately what matters most. 

With a tremendous performance by the defense in the second half that included two sacks and two forced turnovers, the Commanders did enough to start the season 1-0 with a 20-16 win over the Arizona Cardinals. The result created some mixed emotions from the Burgundy & Gold. They were happy to get a win, but the prevailing thought was that they could, and should, have done better. 

"We had some opportunities that we didn't take care of the football in the way we should have," Rivera told reporters after the win. "We will be better."

The Commanders' defense was the primary reason the team was in the game long enough to retake and extend the lead in the fourth quarter. In addition to holding the Josh Dobbs-led Cardinals offense out of the end zone, they held their opponents to 210 total yards, including 96 on the ground. In the second half, they ensured the Cardinals could not extend their lead by holding the team to 86 yards on six possessions.

They also had several key momentum-swinging plays that gave enough energy for the offense to show some life. Both of their forced fumbles came in the second half and gave the offense ideal field position, which the unit then turned into 10 points.

Much of that can be traced back to the defensive line, despite not having Chase Young in the season opener. Montez Sweat filled the stat sheet with five tackles, two forced fumbles, 1.5 sacks, a quarterback hit and two tackles for loss. There were times when Daron Payne, who had two tackles for loss, seemed unblockable for the Cardinals' defensive line. Jonathan Allen was as disruptive as ever, recording three tackles and a fourth-quarter sack.

While the Commanders' defense was smothering the Cardinals, their offense was struggling to gain its footing. They got on the board first with a six-play, 91-yard drive, helped by two personal fouls and a pass interference call from the Cardinals, and capped things off with a seven-yard touchdown by Sam Howell to Brian Robinson Jr.

But the offense could never quite build on any momentum it got in the first half. A Cardinals field goal was followed by an interception from Howell off a tipped pass at the line of scrimmage. On the next drive, a promising 59-yard drive was cut short with a fumble by Antonio Gibson at the Cardinals' 16-yard line. It also didn't help that Washington allowed six sacks. Some were on Howell as he scrambled out of bounds to avoid pressure, but some were on the offensive line as well.

Then the back-breaker: a strip-sack on Howell that forced him to cough the ball up and resulted in a Cardinals defensive touchdown.

The Commanders were able to get in field goal range and cut into the Cardinals' lead, but a 13-10 score felt more relieving than hopeful.

It wasn't until the final seconds of the third quarter that things started to turn around. Sweat forced a fumble from Dobbs at the Cardinals' 25-yard line, and it was scooped up by Payne at the 29. Seven plays later, Howell scrambled six yards into the end zone, giving Washington a 17-16 lead with under 12 minutes to go.

It was here that Washington's defense started to take over. The unit forced a three-and-out on the ensuing drive, and with about four minutes left, Sweat forced another fumble that was picked up by Abdullah Anderson. Another unsportsmanlike penalty on the Cardinals moved the ball up to the Cardinals' 22-yard line, leading to a Commanders' field goal that made the score 20-16.

Finally, with some help from an eight-yard sack from Allen and a pass breakup on fourth down by Emmanuel Forbes Jr., the Commanders were able to run out the clock and leave FedExField with a come-from-behind win to start the season.

After the game, Rivera said he was "happy as hell" that Washington pulled out a victory, but he knows there's plenty of room to grow.

"I really appreciate the fans coming out. We have to be a better football team for them."

Comment
There are two ways of looking at the debut of the Washington Commanders’ new-look offense.

The charitable way: The West Coast scheme relies on timing and spacing, which take time to hone, and growing pains were expected. Quarterback Sam Howell flashed playmaking promise, especially on his two touchdowns, and coordinator Eric Bieniemy adapted to the game flow by prioritizing the run late. The six sacks didn’t expose an Achilles’ heel, because the responsibility for them was split among blocking, Howell’s occasionally lagging internal clock and, at least once, a combination of Howell and a longer-developing play call. All those issues are fixable, and as the offense coheres, Bieniemy will maximize everyone better and complement the strong defense. Give it time.

Never miss a goal or a touchdown. Sign up for Sports Alerts to receive email alerts on major sports news as soon as it breaks.
The uncharitable way: For all the talk of Bieniemy’s attention to detail, the offense was not crisp in a near-loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Neither touchdown drive was impressive — the first fueled by defensive penalties and the second on a short field — and the unit gave away the ball three times. Bieniemy called 14 runs in the last 17 plays because he didn’t trust the passing game. Given the ball at the Arizona 22-yard line with 4:38 to go and a one-point lead, Bieniemy didn’t even try to put the Cardinals away with a touchdown, pounding the rock three straight times and taking the field goal. Coach Ron Rivera bet too big on unproven pieces in Howell, Bieniemy and the offensive line. It will never work.


For now, the fairest assessment skews charitable. It’s one game with new faces in pivotal roles. Players and coaches know the 20-16 win was a bad first impression — “horrible,” in the words of running back Antonio Gibson, who fumbled in the red zone. Players insisted the offense can be better Sunday at the Denver Broncos, and after reviewing the film Monday, Rivera seemed confident in the same belief.

Hail or Fail: Dominating defense helps Commanders overcome three turnovers

“[It’s] never as bad as you think and never as good as you think,” Rivera said of Howell. “There were some really good things that happened; there were some really good rhythm stuff that was on. And then there was some things that were just kind of like, ‘Ooh, why’d you do that?’ ”

Despite the small sample size, the opener did provide two concrete conclusions: Howell is tough, and Howell is resilient.


Those takeaways might seem trite but are important. Even though his teammates called him tough and resilient all summer and even though a few moments from his previous games suggested they were right, there is now real proof from a real game with stakes.

The toughness showed early. On the second drive, Cardinals linebacker Kyzir White delivered a late hit to Howell’s helmet as he slid out of bounds. Howell bounced up, passed a concussion test and looked mostly poised as he kept the offense moving. He seemed to never let pressure from previous snaps affect current ones, which was a shift from some previous quarterbacks.

“With [Howell] being a smaller dude, we did want to test his toughness a little bit,” Cardinals defensive end Carlos Watkins said. “But I thought he held up decent. He didn’t seem scared or nothing. Just took the hits and kept moving.”


“He got a lot of heart,” White said, adding, “I tip my hat.”

The resilience showed late. The offense broke down in the second half as penalties and sacks led to difficult conversions of third and 25 and third and 20. Bieniemy shifted to a run-heavy approach, and Howell, patient, handed the ball off again and again. On third down from the 6-yard line, when Bieniemy was forced to call a pass play, Howell made a quick read, escaped the pocket and ran into the end zone. He had stayed ready for the big moment; the touchdown gave Washington the lead for good.

“You never saw him shaken; you never saw him with his head down,” wide receiver Terry McLaurin said. “He’s going to learn and grow, and that’s the thing about this: He’s our guy. We’re going to support him, but as a whole collective we could do a better job just staying on track and helping him out.”

What to know from Week 1 of the 2023 NFL season

Toughness and resilience will be key for Howell all year. His athleticism and arm strength embolden him to take chances, and as he tries to make plays, he inevitably will make mistakes such as the sack-fumble for a touchdown. And he will run a fair amount, so he will need to play through hits — as well as have the smarts to avoid the biggest ones. The development of the entire offense probably will rely heavily on Howell keeping up the intangibles he showed against Arizona.


Here’s why it’s difficult to read too much into the results of Sunday: Washington played basically the same game Week 1 in 2022. It seized an early lead against a poorly regarded opponent, nearly fumbled the game away in the middle and roared back late with an impressive play by a new quarterback and a game-sealing turnover by the defense.

Last year, the offense never again scored as many points as it did in Week 1. In the locker room Sunday, the primary emotion for offensive players wasn’t relief, as it was in 2022. It seemed to be frustration; they thought they were better than that. Left tackle Charles Leno Jr. said the similarities between the games stopped in the box score.

“This year just feels different,” he said. “For some reason, it just feels different. I don’t know how to explain it.”

It seems quite possible the explanation is, as Rivera once said, the quarterback.

5 takeaways from Cowboys' 40-0 drubbing of Giants on Sunday Night Football
Dallas dominated New York in all facets inside a rainy MetLife Stadium

It was an eventful Sunday full of surprises. The first week of the 2023 NFL season set the stage for what fans can expect this year.

Rain wasn't the only thing that poured on the New York Giants Sunday night.

Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Pollard jogged into the endzone on a one-yard touchdown run. Jogged. The scoreboard ballooned to 33-0 in the third quarter at MetLife Stadium.

It ended 40-0.

New York just had no answer offensively, which gave Dallas a perfect platform to capitalize with easy points that increased the gap.

Let's dive into the analysis in more depth with five takeaways:


NFL
SEP 10
NFL Week 1 winners and losers: Calvin Ridley is back, Steelers, Tagovailoa among headliners

CINCINNATI BENGALS
SEP 7
Report: Joe Burrow agrees to record 5-year, $275 million extension with Bengals
A one-play momentum changer
New York started with the ball and drove 48 yards down the field in 11 plays (the last was a fumbled snap on third down that lost yards) that consumed seven minutes off the clock. Until the mishap, the Giants were coordinated and confident. Then Graham Gano's ensuing field goal attempt was blocked and returned 58 yards for a touchdown by Noah Igbinoghene.

New York never looked coordinated and confident again. And Dallas never looked back.

Daniel Jones suffers in forgettable night
Jones signed a four-year, $160 million contract with the Giants this past offseason. That equals to $40 million a year. He finished the game with 104 passing yards on 15-for-28 completions, no touchdowns and two picks. He was sacked seven times and added 43 rushing yards on 13 attempts. That's not what a $40 million player should provide.

Of course, the weather and poor offensive line play weren't optimal for Jones' sake, but these signs were discernible in previous seasons unless he made noteworthy improvements as a pocket passer. That didn't seem to be the case in Week 1.

Post-Ezekiel Elliott life starts strong for Dallas
For the first time since 2016, Dallas started a game without Elliott in the backfield. It was time to move on anyways, and they didn't miss a beat with Tony Pollard, Rico Dowdle and KaVontae Turpin getting it done in their respective ways. Pollard, in particular, looked sharp with his 70 yards on 14 carries and two touchdowns. Turpin added a rushing touchdown as well.

Their production made the night that much easier for Dak Prescott, who didn't stand out statistically -- 143 yards on 13-for-24 passing, no touchdowns and no picks -- but also didn't need to.

Giants' lack of WR quality on display
New York made the playoffs last season with Darius Slayton as its most productive wideout. Slayton posted 46 catches for 724 yards and two touchdowns in 16 games. The Giants simply needed more to reach the next level, but this loss became quite evident they may regress.

Darren Waller led in the receiving department on the night, but none of that influenced the game significantly. He had three catches for 36 yards, with the next highest being Isaiah Hodgins with one catch for 24 yards. Yeah, that's simply not good enough.

Cowboys' stellar defense looks Super Bowl-level
Defenses win championships, and Dallas seems to possess a capable unit. New York's offensive line didn't exactly supply any resistance to the Cowboys' pressure, but seven sacks and 11 QB hits is nothing to gloss over. Not to mention the countless times they knocked out the ball from New York's hands, even if they didn't recover the fumble in wet conditions.

Dallas also had eight passes defended, with Stephon Gilmore accounting for three by himself. Again, the Cowboys didn't have much to defend and the real tests will come later, but it's a promising sign for defensive coordinator Dan Quinn.

5 takeaways from Cowboys' 40-0 drubbing of Giants on Sunday Night Football

It was an eventful Sunday full of surprises. The first week of the 2023 NFL season set the stage for what fans can expect this year.

Rain wasn't the only thing that poured on the New York Giants Sunday night.

Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Pollard jogged into the endzone on a one-yard touchdown run. Jogged. The scoreboard ballooned to 33-0 in the third quarter at MetLife Stadium.

It ended 40-0.

New York just had no answer offensively, which gave Dallas a perfect platform to capitalize with easy points that increased the gap.

Let's dive into the analysis in more depth with five takeaways:


NFL
SEP 10
NFL Week 1 winners and losers: Calvin Ridley is back, Steelers, Tagovailoa among headliners

CINCINNATI BENGALS
SEP 7
Report: Joe Burrow agrees to record 5-year, $275 million extension with Bengals
A one-play momentum changer
New York started with the ball and drove 48 yards down the field in 11 plays (the last was a fumbled snap on third down that lost yards) that consumed seven minutes off the clock. Until the mishap, the Giants were coordinated and confident. Then Graham Gano's ensuing field goal attempt was blocked and returned 58 yards for a touchdown by Noah Igbinoghene.

New York never looked coordinated and confident again. And Dallas never looked back.

Daniel Jones suffers in forgettable night
Jones signed a four-year, $160 million contract with the Giants this past offseason. That equals to $40 million a year. He finished the game with 104 passing yards on 15-for-28 completions, no touchdowns and two picks. He was sacked seven times and added 43 rushing yards on 13 attempts. That's not what a $40 million player should provide.

Of course, the weather and poor offensive line play weren't optimal for Jones' sake, but these signs were discernible in previous seasons unless he made noteworthy improvements as a pocket passer. That didn't seem to be the case in Week 1.

Post-Ezekiel Elliott life starts strong for Dallas
For the first time since 2016, Dallas started a game without Elliott in the backfield. It was time to move on anyways, and they didn't miss a beat with Tony Pollard, Rico Dowdle and KaVontae Turpin getting it done in their respective ways. Pollard, in particular, looked sharp with his 70 yards on 14 carries and two touchdowns. Turpin added a rushing touchdown as well.

Their production made the night that much easier for Dak Prescott, who didn't stand out statistically -- 143 yards on 13-for-24 passing, no touchdowns and no picks -- but also didn't need to.

Tua the Talk of NFL Nation
Tua Tagovailoa's 466 passing yards was among the highest total in NFL history for a season opener

Miami Dolphins
MIAMI DOLPHINS
The Miami Dolphins started the 2023 NFL season with a thrilling 36-34 victory on the road against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.

The game was a back-and-forth battle that required an impressive second-half performance from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, which captured the attention of the national media.

Tagovailoa finished the game with 466 passing yards, marking the fourth most all time in a season opener and the second-most in Dolphins history. He also completed 62.2 percent of his passes with three touchdowns and one interception.

Here’s a look at the national media’s reaction to Tagovailoa’s impressive performance.

Media Reaction to Tagovailoa vs. Chargers
NFL Insider Cameron Wolfe is still thinking about Tagovailoa’s dime to Tyreek Hill in the fourth quarter. Considering the situation (third down, late in the fourth quarter) and difficulty (off-platform throw), there’s an argument it was the best throw of Tagovailoa’s career.


ESPN’s Mina Kimes has been tentative with her praise of Tagovailoa in the past, but even she was impressed with Tagovailoa’s fourth-quarter pass to Hill.


The Ringer’s Benjamin Solak is another national analyst who has been skeptical of Tagovailoa. However, he believes Sunday’s game was the best of the young quarterback’s career.


ADVERTISING



ESPN’s Mike Greenberg, a noted Jets fan, believes Tagovailoa played well enough to enter the MVP conversation after just one game. It seems the betting sharps agree, as Tagovailoa is now the co-favorite to win MVP on DraftKings Sportsbook.



Monday morning, Pat McAfee went on his show to rave about Tagovailoa’s connection with wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Hill finished Sunday’s game with 11 catches for 215 yards and two touchdowns on 15 targets.


McAfee believes Sunday’s game proved Tagovailoa and Hill are more in sync this season, and the early returns seem to be trending in that direction.


Stephan A. Smith went on First Take Monday morning to praise Tagovailoa. Smith believes staying healthy is the only thing holding Tagovailoa back from a great season.



FOX Sports analyst Emmanuel Acho was among the few national media members to say he would take Tagovailoa over Justin Herbert last season.

Although that debate is far from over, that didn’t stop Acho from taking a victory lap on Twitter. To be fair, Tagovailoa was the better quarterback on Sunday.



Sports Illustrated senior writer Connor Orr didn’t mince words about how well he thought Tagovailoa played, writing:

“We were wrong to doubt the quarterback, to paint him as injury prone, to diminish him as a product of the system, to take digs at his fitness. Did you see the game-winning touchdown he threw against the Chargers on Sunday? A goal-line fade to a wide receiver the size of your middle school basketball league’s power forward? That isn’t a throw for a puppet quarterback. That’s a one-putt through the windmill on hole 18 of the world’s most ridiculous mini-golf course. He did it with time winding down on the road with one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL sitting on the opposite bench.”


Orr wasn’t the only national columnist making bold statements about Tagovailoa.

Pro Football Talk’s Peter King covered the quarterback’s stellar Week 1 showing in his Football Morning in America column, writing:

“But this was one of Tua’s best games at any level, ever. That was impressive. This game just felt so significant, even giving up so much ground to the Chargers in a 36-34 win at SoFi Stadium because Tagovailoa has been such a lightning rod, and no one knows if he can stay healthy for 17 weeks. Here, Tagovailoa wasn’t sacked, wasn’t abused, threw for 466 yards and three touchdowns. He was in command. You could just see it.”


It’s hard to say this was Tagovailoa’s best game at any level. He had some wildly impressive games with the Crimson Tide, but there’s a compelling case for this one taking that crown.

The Chargers had the Dolphins’ number in their matchup last season. That wasn’t the case on Sunday, as Tagovailoa racked up high-level throw after throw. As King put it: “He was in command. You could just see it.”



Dolphins 2023 Week 1 Snap Count Observations
Durham Smythe, DeShon Elliott and Andrew Van Ginkel were among the Miami Dolphins with noteworthy playing time against the Los Angeles Chargers

Miami Dolphins
MIAMI DOLPHINS
What stood out about the Miami Dolphins snap counts from their 36-34 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Sunday.

-- As a reminder, the inactives were T Terron Armstead, DB Elijah Campbell, WR Cedrick Wilson Jr., RB De'Von Achane and TE Julian Hill, while Skylar Thompson served as the third (emergency) quarterback and he could only play in the event both Tua Tagovailoa and Mike White got injured.


-- There were four players who were active but did not play: White, DB Verone McKinley III, CB Parry Nickerson and T Kion Smith.

-- Seven position players saw their only action on special teams, including 2022 seventh-round pick Cameron Goode, who was elevated from the practice squad Saturday. The others were CB Kelvin Joseph, CB Cam Smith, LB Channing Tindall, RB Chris Brooks and OL Lester Cotton.


DOLPHINS OFFENSIVE OBSERVATIONS
-- Because the Dolphins produced more big plays, they had fewer offensive snaps than the Chargers, 81-67.

-- What stands out on offense is tight end Durham Smythe played all 67 of those snaps. Every single one. That's really, really unusual for any tight end. We said before the cuts to the 53-player limit that Smythe was the only sure thing at tight end on the roster, and it sure manifested itself there. The only other tight end who got snaps was veteran Tyler Kroft, but it was only two of them. While we wouldn't expect Smythe to play every snap every game, there's no reason to think he won't continue to be the main guy at the position.


-- With Jeff Wilson Jr. on injured reserve, Raheem Mostert got most of the snaps at running back, with 49 compared ot 19 for Salvon Ahmed. We explained before the game that perhaps Brooks could be used in short-yardage situations, but the Dolphins had no third-and-1 or fourth-and-1 and only one third-and-2, which featured an incompletion on a pass intended for Smythe.


-- On a third-and-3, the Dolphins had wide receiver Erik Ezukanma lining up in the backfield and he got the carry, gaining 7 yards on a play where center Connor Williams was flagged for holding. Ezukanma earlier had a 12-yard gain on an end-around on one of his 19 snaps.

-- At wide receiver, the work load was fairly well spread out among Tyreek Hill (44 snaps), Jaylen Waddle (43), Braxton Berrios (35) and River Cracraft (27), which followed what we expected to be the pecking order.


-- Finally on the offensive line, it was Isaiah Wynn who got the call at left guard after Dolphins coaches (Mike McDaniel and Frank Smith) declined to declare a starter throughout the week. Wynn did miss one play in the second quarter for an unknown reason, but he ended up playing 66 of the 67 snaps.



DOLPHINS DEFENSIVE OBSERVATIONS
-- As was the case with left guard, there never was an official announcement as to who would start at safety beside Jevon Holland, but DeShon Elliott not only got the nod, he became one of three players to play all 81 defensive snaps. The other two were Holland and linebacker Jerome Baker.


-- Cornerbacks Kader Kohou and Xavien Howard each played 98 snaps and, as expected, it was Eli Apple who got the most work outside when Kohou was used in the slot, playing 60 snaps.

-- Jaelan Phillips (73) and Bradley Chubb (71) got the bulk of the work on the edge, while Emmanuel Ogbah ended up playing 18 snaps.


-- At inside linebacker, it was very surprising to see Andrew Van Ginkel play 51 snaps compared to only 17 for free agent acquisition David Long Jr., and perhaps that was due to the Chargers focusing on their running game for a good part of the afternoon and Van Ginkel being more stout against the run.

-- Christian Wilkins (68 snaps) and Zach Sieler (65) got their usual heavy loads on the defensive line, while Raekwon Davis played 46 snaps, his second-most snaps in any game since his rookie season of 2020. Rookie free agent Brandon Pili ended up playing only nine snaps in his NFL debut.


-- Safety Brandon Jones played two snaps on defense and 18 more on special teams in his first game since he tore an ACL last November.

-- On special teams, Riley and Joseph led the way with 24 snaps, followed by Cam Smith with 23. The offensive player with the most special teams snaps was Ahmed with 17 followed by Smythe, who supplemented his full load on offense with 15 snaps in the kicking game.

Dolphins-Chargers Week 1 Complete Observations
Breaking down the key moments from the Miami Dolphins' thrilling 36-34 Week 1 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium

Miami Dolphins
MIAMI DOLPHINS
Here's what caught our eye during the Miami Dolphins' 36-34 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Sunday.

-- As always, we'll start with the inactive list, which was headed by Pro Bowl tackle Terron Armstead and also included rookie third-round pick De'Von Achane, a move that eye-opening perhaps but not necessarily surprising.

-- Also inactive were WR Cedrick Wilson Jr., DB Elijah Campbell and TE Julian Hill.

-- Among those active were 2022 fourth-round pick Erik Ezukanma, who got the nod over Wilson, and DB Justin Bethel, who had been listed as questionable with a knee injury on the final injury report of the week.

-- Skylar Thompson was designated as the third quarterback, allowing him to be uniform and come into the game (but only if Tua Tagovailoa and Mike White both were injured).



FIRST QUARTER
-- In a starting lineup note, it indeed was Isaiah Wynn who started at left guard — after coaches refused to answer that question throughout the week.

-- After the Chargers won the toss and deferred, the Dolphins put together a brilliant first drive before it ended in disaster when a bad center-QB exchange on first-and-goal from the 2-yard line produced a fumble that the Chargers recovered.


-- Before that, though, the Dolphins had gains of 16, 35 and 12 yards, with some creative play-calling, some of the same formula as last year and the speed of Hill and Waddle.

-- Waddle had the long gain, a 36-yard pick-up, after easily beating J.C. Jackson from the slot with a quick slant and then using his speed to get outside.


-- Erik Ezukanma showed a replay of something he did in the preseason with a nifty 12-yard gain on an end-around, thanks with some good blocking in front of him.

-- Replays seemed to indicate there was nothing wrong with the snap from Connor Williams and that Tua Tagovailoa just dropped the ball, which the Chargers recovered at their 6-yard line.


-- The Dolphins defense's appearance of the season was highly disappointing, with the Chargers marching 94 yards, all but two of them running plays.

-- The Chargers converted two third-down situations, each of them on scrambles by Justin Herbert.

-- The big play of the drive was a 36-yard completion from Herbert to Keenan Allen, who was being covered by linebacker David Long Jr. That's clearly not a good matchup for the Dolphins.


-- The longest run of the drive was only 10 yards, but there were four other rushes by running backs that gained 6 yards. That's kinda surprising given how good the Dolphins run defense was last sseason.

-- The Dolphins marched the ball downfield again on their second possession, but this one ended with a touchdown.


-- After Tua underthrew Tyreek Hill on a deep pass on first down, he came right back with a strike down the middle of the field to River Cracraft for a 24-yard gain.

-- On a third-down run where Ezukanma lined up in the backfield and gained the first down, Williams was flagged for holding down the field when he held on longer than he should have against linebacker Eric Kendricks, who wasn't going to be able to make the tackle anyway.


-- The Dolphins converted the ensuing third-and-6 thanks to a nice escape from Tua in the pocket combined with a dart to Braxton Berrios. That came after Joey Bosa grabbed Tua's facemask in the backfield and the gain plus penalty put the ball at the 14-yard line.

-- Raheem Mostert then gained 12 yards through a gaping hole at the line before fighting his way through for a 2-yard touchdown.


-- The quarter ended with the Chargers facing a third-and-2 after a running play and the Dolphins defense doing a good job of not jumping as Herbert lined up in shotgun trying to get an offside and free first down.

SECOND QUARTER
-- The Dolphins got the stop after a false start when Jaelan Phillps' pressure from the outside disrupted the pocket and led to an incompletion.


-- The Dolphins was at it again on their third drive, moving 57 yards on two quick plays when Tua connected with Tyreek Hill deep over the middle for 29 and 28 yards. On the first play, Hill was matched up against Jackson, who the Dolphins victimized again in a way they never did when Jackson was with New England.

-- The Dolphins then moved to a first-and-goal at the 5 on a nifty bootleg pass to fullback Alec Ingold for a 15-yard gain.


-- The drive stalled after Hill caught a pass at the 1-yard line on second down, but the Chargers won their challenge that his second foot came down out of bounds.

-- On third drive, Tua tried to fit a pass to Durham Smythe in the end zone, but safety Derwin James knocked the ball away with a nice defensive play.


-- The Dolphins lead didn't last very long, and it was the run defense that again was the culprit.

-- Austin Ekeler broke loose for a 55-yard gain to the Dolphins 9-yard line when he burst through a hole over the middle where Christian Wilkins and Raekwon Davis were cleared out by the Chargers line.

-- The Dolphins had their first three-and-out on offense on the next drive despite a really good 8-yard run by Salvon Ahmed where he broke a tackle attempt by James in the backfield.


-- Tua underthrew Waddle deep on first down, then tried to squeeze a thrown downfield over the middle to Smythe on third-and-2 despite Smythe being surrounded by three defenders.

-- Justin Bethel showed his value on special teams when he tackled explosive rookie Derius Davis after only a 3-yard return on the ensuing punt.


-- The Dolphins answered the Chargers' defensive three-and-out  even after giving up a 7-yard gain on first down.

-- Christian Wilkins made the tackles on second and third down, though it was linebacker Jerome Baker who blew up a third-and-2 shovel pass to rookie Quentin Johnston.

-- The Dolphins' next drive featured a lot of Durham Smythe, who caught passes for 18, 16 and 10 yards.


-- That last one came on fourth-and-7 from the Chargers with 3;09 left in the half when Mike McDaniel decided to get uber-aggressive. Smythe released late and found himself wide open to the left of the formation.

-- Two plays later, Tua connected with Hill down the middle for a 19-yard line to the Chargers 13 at the two-minute warning.


-- The Dolphins capped the drive with a touchdown after three more completions from Tua, the last a 1-yarder to Cracraft for a touchdown that gave Miami a 17-14 lead.

-- After that touchdown drive, the Dolphins had 304 yards of offense, including 242 passing yards by Tua.

-- The Dolphins had a chance to get off the field on the next drive, but gave up a completion to Keenan Allen, followed by two more pick-ups of 11 and 15 to get the Chargers into field goal range.


-- Cameron Dicker's 50-yard field goal tied the score 17-17 with 9 seconds left.

-- But, yeah, the Dolphins weren't going to just kneel, so Tua threw a 22-yard completion to Waddle that put the ball at the 47 with 2 seconds  left before the Dolphins got a 30-yard DPI penalty on Jackson against Ezukanma, giving them a chance at a 41-yard field goal attempt that Jason Sanders nailed for a 20-17 Dolphins lead at the half.



THIRD QUARTER
-- The third quarter began with another disappointing effort from the Dolphins defense who let the Chargers march 75 yards for a touchdown without a single completion by Herbert.


-- The drive featured 57 rushing yards, including a 14-yard run by Joshua Kelley and an 11-yard run by Ekeler, but also three penalties on the defense.

-- Xavien Howard was flagged for defensive pass interference, including one in the end zone, which was followed by another penalty on the Dolphins for too many men on the field.


-- Herbert's touchdown put the Dolphins behind 24-20.

-- After going pass-heavy for most of the first half, the Dolphins ran on each of the four first-down plays on their opening drive of the half, though those plays totaled exactly minus-1 yard.

-- The Dolphins got into scoring position anyway, thanks in large part to a 30-yard connection from Tua to HIll.


-- But the drive ended on a third-and-12 from the Chargers 26 when Tua tried to force the issue with a pass to Braxton Berrios in the end zone. It was picked off by Jackson after a slight shove that under certain circumstances will draw a flag.

-- Jackson made the bad decision of getting out of the end zone after the pick and was pushed out of bounds at the 4 by Jaylen Waddle, which set up the Dolphins for an important sequence.


-- On third-and-1 from the 13, the Chargers called for a pass by the Dolphins sent Kader Kohou on a blitz and he had a clear path to Herbert, bringing him down for a 12-yard sack to the 1-yard line. That was another example of Kohou's great tackling ability.

-- After only a 34-yard punt, the Dolphins set up shop at the Chargers 35 and they needed only one play to regain the lead when Tua hit Hill in stride after he easily got behind Jackson.


-- The defensive struggles continued on the next series, though, with the defense losing track of Ekeler after he leaked out of the backfield for a 35-yard gain toward the end of the third quarter.

FOURTH QUARTER
-- Four plays into the fourth quarter, the Charges completed their 75-yard drive to retake the lead, 31-27.


-- The Dolphins responded with a field goal drive thanks in large part to two completions to Braxton Berrios, the first coming after Tagovailoa did a nice job of escaping pressure and throwing on the. move.

-- On the second one, a 15-yard completion to the Chargers 30, Berrios did a great job of getting his hands under a throw next to the ground and the play was upheld after the Chargers challenged the ruling.


-- After Jason Sanders' 45-yard field goal made it 31-30, the defense gave a drive that took 6:10 but kept the Chargers out of the end zone.

-- The big play of the drive was a 24-yard pass from Herbert to Mike Williams on a pretty throw over Jerome Baker and in front of the defensive backs.

-- A key sequence took place afer the Chargers got a first down at the Miami 12 and they were kept out of the end zone.

-- Jaelan Phillps got late pressure on the third-and-5 incompletion to Williams with safety DeShon Elliott providing very good coverage in the end zone.

-- The Dolphins began their game-winning drive at their 25 and got a minor scare when officials ruled the Chargers had scored a touchdown on a fumble return, though the ruling was overturned after replay clearly showed Salvon Ahmed never had full possession of the ball.

-- Then came the big play, Tua's 47-yard completion to Hill after he stepped up in the pocket to avoid pressure. It was a brilliant play all around, from Tua's movement, to the way he led Hill, to Hill's sliding catch.

-- A 15-yard completion over the middle to Cracraft moved the ball to the 9-yard line at the two-minute warning and at that point it was just a matter of when and how the Dolphins would score.

-- The winning touchdown came on a floater in the corner of the end zone when Tua and Hill took advantage of cornerback Michael Davis never turning around for the ball, which went right over him into the chest of Hill.

-- There was cause for concern, though, after Jason Sanders pushed the PAT attempt wide right, leaving the Dolphins up only 36-34.

-- The Chargers did get a first down on the first play of their final drive, but then the Dolphins moved them backward.

-- First, there was an intentional grounding penalty on Herbert in the face of pressure, though it did appear he had Kelley in the vicinity of his pass.

-- Zach Sieler then sacked Herbert on second down when the line collapsed the pocket and, after a 17-yard completion made it fourth-and-12, Jaelen Phillips and Justin Bethel shared the sack that sealed the victory.

-- All that was left to do was for Tua to take two knees to wrap up a most satisfying victory to start off the season.







FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — A quartet of teams were red hot in the red zone in Week 1 of the 2023 season, and they are all undefeated heading into Week 2.

That includes the Atlanta Falcons.

En route to their 24-10 win over the Carolina Panthers last Sunday, the Falcons cashed all three of their red-zone visits into touchdowns. It just so happens the three other perfect teams – Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams and Green Bay Packers, who the Falcons host Sunday (1 p.m. FOX) in Mercedes-Benz Stadium – ended up with the exact same stat line.

"In my opinion, you want to get down there seven or eight times," Atlanta head coach Arthur Smith said. "That's a high goal. That's usually not what happens."

He's right. The most red-zone appearances the Falcons had in 2022 was five in Week 17 against the Arizona Cardinals. Atlanta scored on just two of those appearances but still managed to pull out the win.

That goes to show that a 100% red-zone conversion rate isn't required to win, but the same goes vice versa. A 100% red-zone conversion rate doesn't guarantee a victory either.

In 2022, the Falcons had three games with a clean red-zone record. They went 1-2 in those shows.

Opening flawless like Atlanta did against Carolina is still a good thing, though, because last year, the Falcons' strongest red-zone games didn't come until Weeks 5-7. And by the end of that run, the Falcons were 3-4.

They're 1-0 right now.

It's worth dissecting the three red-zone situations against the Panthers since they're what led to all three of the Falcons' touchdowns.

The first one overlapped between the first and second quarters, set up by an interception from Falcons safety Jessie Bates III. Atlanta was already at Carolina's 17-yard line when the offense took the field, and it took just three plays to make it into the end zone:

-- Q1, 1-10-CAR17: QB Desmond Ridder 1-yard pass to RB Bijan Robinson.

-- Q1, 2-9-CAR16: RB Bijan Robinson 5-yard run.

-- Q2, 3-4-CAR11: QB Desmond Ridder 11-yard pass to RB Bijan Robinson, TOUCHDOWN.

The next scoring drive spanned the third and fourth quarters and was credit to another defensive turnover by Bates, this time a forced fumble. The Falcons began their drive at their own 39-yard line, and used five plays to break into the Panthers' red zone and then another two to score once there.

-- Q4, 1-4-CAR4: RB Tyler Allgeier 1-yard run.

-- Q4, 2-3-CAR3: RB Tyler Allgeier 3-yard run, TOUCHDOWN.

The final series – obviously – came in the fourth quarter alone, and it was partially in thanks to the Falcons' defense again, since it forced the Panthers to go three-and-out. The drive began at the Atlanta 44-yard line. The Falcons needed four plays to reach the r zone and then sealed the deal with another 1-2 punch.

-- Q4, 1-7-CAR-7: RB Tyler Allgeier 4-yard run.

-- Q4, 2-3-CAR3: RB Tyler Allgeier 3-yard run, TOUCHDOWN.

Tyler Allgeier punches it in for second TD of game
All of this to say: The Falcons' running backs really delivered in the red zone Sunday.

"I call that last-mile delivery inside the five," Smith said. "There's some guys that have it, some guys that don't. When you look at the really good red-zone teams, when I've been a part of the really good red-zone teams, you got guys that can punch that ball in. We got a lot of guys that can do that now, so that makes you a lot better in the red zone."

And that, right there, has been a point of emphasis for the Falcons since late last season.

Atlanta closed out 2022 with a 30-for-54 success rate in the red zone. That ranked the team 14th overall in the NFL, tied with the Rams and Denver Broncos. None of them had a winning record – 7-10 Falcons, 5-12 Rams and Broncos – nor did they make the playoffs.

The Dallas Cowboys boasted the best conversation rate, 40 of 56. They made it to the divisional round and finished 12-5.

The Kansas City Chiefs (14-3) claimed the second-best mark (50 of 72) and won the Super Bowl. Their title opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles (14-3), were third (40 of 59).

It's actually quite simple.

"You try to score touchdowns," Smith said. "You try to win the game."

Atlanta Falcons
ATLANTA FALCONS
Two of the top-10 picks from this year's NFL Draft are set to square off in Week 1 as Bryce Young's Carolina Panthers play Bijan Robinson's Atlanta Falcons.

The Panthers traded up from the No. 9 pick, one spot behind the Falcons, to acquire Young, who they hope will be their next franchise quarterback.

Meanwhile, despite other positions of need on the board, the Falcons opted to select running back Bijan Robinson, making him the highest-selected running back in the draft since Saquon Barkley back in 2018.

The two played against each other last year in college, where Young's Alabama Crimson Tide edged out Bijan's Texas Longhorns. Last night, Texas got revenge on Alabama with a win in Tuscaloosa, and Falcons fans hope Bijan can get revenge on Young and the Panthers.

If the Falcons win today, it will be their first Week 1 victory since 2017, as well as their first time over .500 since that time. It would give Atlanta a lot of momentum in a season where the NFC South title could be within reach.

From 2016 to 2019, I produced a GIF review series every week, breaking down the previous Falcons’ game. Each week, I’d post multiple GIFs to analyze the biggest highlights, lowlights, and most fascinating moments from each matchup. The time is now to bring it back right here on The Falcoholic.

For those that didn’t follow the review series on Twitter, I would break down every snap from every Falcons’ game and decide which offensive and defensive plays deserve to be spotlighted. To keep this at an acceptable rate where nobody’s phone or computer breaks down because of so many GIFs on one page, I will assess the top ten most significant or notable offensive and defensive plays from the Falcons’ win over the Panthers.

What better way to start than reviewing one of the greatest plays made inside the Mercedes-Benz Stadium since 2017?


Bijan lights it up
This is one of the most extraordinary touchdowns you will see all season. There are possibly six players in the league that can turn a five-yard loss into an eleven-yard touchdown. Setting him in motion adds a fun wrinkle to this, but the alignment couldn’t have been more unfavorable. On third and five, in the red zone, it’s hard to comprehend how Arthur Smith thought this was a good idea, besides the fact of knowing you are putting the ball in the hands of a special playmaker.

It’s astonishing to watch the eighth overall pick bend to dodge Frankie Luvu running at him at full speed. To follow it up by splitting Vonn Bell and Shaq Thompson makes this a jaw-dropping moment for a player who will likely produce numerous highlight-reel plays this season. The way he sets up going outside to dip inside of Bell, eventually forcing him to collide with Thompson, is brilliant.

Bijan Robinson has the agility of an electrifying scatback and the strength of a bruising power back. With his running style and football intelligence, the sky is the limit for him. Touchdowns like this prove that.




The subtle movement, vision, and burst from Robinson make eight to ten-yard runs like this look routine. His ability to remain patient and change speeds in a flash creates big-play opportunities by allowing holes to develop and using his explosiveness to get to the second level. While it’s another well-blocked play led by the tight ends and McGary, Robinson is able to gain extra yardage with his blistering speed. Turning four to six-yard runs into double-digit gains makes a significant difference, especially when the offense has no drop-back passing game.



Arthur Smith will break out these kind of counter runs when he sees a defense is reeling. Avery Williams broke loose on one last year against Cleveland, which proved to be the running game’s coming out party. It catches the defense off guard with Keith Smith running a counter and Drew Dalman pulling to the backside to make a crucial seal block.

With the entire line blocking right, both blocks are needed to get Robinson loose into the open field. Smith’s fierce lead block on Thompson and Dalman’s intelligent movement to guide the backside defender away is poetry in motion for this play design to be perfectly executed.



Allgeier Brings That Thunder
The benefits of having plenty of versatility in your offense are on full display. With Kyle Pitts able to be a legitimate threat as an outside receiver, there are essentially three tight ends on the field despite the alignment shaping up as 12 personnel. As MyCole Pruitt goes in motion, he ends up providing an overload on the right to help seal the edge for Tyler Allgeier to be isolated against Jaycee Horn. Pitts and Jonnu Smith make solid blocks in giving Allgeier all the space in the world.

Allgeier looks more agile than last year and makes a terrific cut to evade Horn. It’s hard to remember the second-year back forcing a missed tackle last season without his sheer power and determination. A sharp cut and increased agility reveal the work he put in the off-season to evolve as a runner. This was the first of what will be many runs over 15 yards.



It’s not just the power, balance, and vision that makes Allgeier a special running back. The patience to stick with it and find an opening creates an opportunity to turn nothing into something on any carry. As Dalman struggles to seal Shy Tuttle off and Matthew Bergeron misses at the second level, the play remains alive thanks to Allgeier’s skill set.

There is no giving up on runs with him. If the blocking isn’t there, he will do everything possible to stay balanced and keep those powerful legs rumbling toward daylight. That daylight proved to be the end zone to give the Falcons the lead.



After pounding the ball consistently for three quarters, the Falcons finally wore down a stout Carolina front seven. They brought in the sledgehammer to finish them off, with Allgeier running behind Keith Smith. The outstanding combo block by Smith to help Dalman is a prime example of what makes this punishing, no-nonsense ground game so efficient.

They know how to make instinctive decisions in a terrific scheme to break formidable defenses down. Jake Matthews guides Deshawn Williams away to create a lane, while Bergeron seals off Luvu to cap off a stellar fourth quarter from the offense. No wide receivers, no disguises. This is how the coaching staff wants to force defenses into submission.



Pass protection debacle
What should have been a promising start to the Falcons’ first drive of the season ended disastrously. With Mack Hollins added in the off-season and Drake London built to thrive as an outside receiver, the Falcons have two wide receivers to allow Pitts more opportunities to be utilized in the slot. Shifting in motion to line him up against Jeremy Chinn presents a fantastic chance to convert on third down.

Pitts couldn’t have won any cleaner at the top of the route by forcing Chinn to the turf off sheer footwork and feints. Unfortunately, Brian Burns’ get-off and chop proved too overwhelming for Kaleb McGary. The star edge rusher showed tremendous bend coming off the edge to strip Desmond Ridder. It was a sluggish set from McGary, who looked a step behind from the beginning. The strip-sack caused not only a three-and-out but also ruined a terrific chance for Ridder and Pitts to start the season out strong in their first regular season game playing together.



Arthur Smith painfully goes ultra-conservative
The Falcons went two for ten on third down. One of the conversions was Robinson’s superhuman touchdown on what should have been a five-yard loss. The complete lack of trust in Ridder and pass protection became quickly apparent as the game wore on. There was no dropback passing game. London and Pitts were afterthoughts. It was another one of those games where questions must be asked about the thought process behind these play calls to convert on third down.

Pitts and Jonnu Smith warrant criticism for blowing their respective blocking assignments. That said, it’s third and 12. This is time for one of your two superb former top-ten pick pass catchers to make a play. They have to be trusted and put in a position to make that happen.


Ridder rattled
As “efficient” as his final numbers were, there was questionable decision-making and erratic passing from Ridder. No decision was more dangerous than trying to thread the needle to Pitts. While it was promising to see play action used out of the shotgun, the coverage simply didn’t allow any opening for this completion to be possible. Carolina’s linebackers didn’t fall for the ball fake, which took away Ridder’s primary read.

It’s clear that he was pressing and forced a throw that could have easily been intercepted. His eyes are glued to Pitts as Bergeron does a nice job of pulling and picking up Burns. Better pocket movement, awareness, and patience would have led to a positive gain by checking it down to Allgeier or Robinson.



Despite the enormous pressure Carolina created in the first half, the playcalling didn’t do much to aid Ridder. The lack of spacing is alarming when assessing this play design. There isn’t anyone stretching the field. If Ridder can’t get the ball out in three seconds, the play becomes broken. Robinson’s poor blitz pickup forces the second-year quarterback to escape the pocket.

To make an already bad situation worse, he desperately attempts to throw the ball across the field. An uninspiring play call followed by a dreadful blitz pickup leading to a perplexing decision could have ended in a catastrophic interception.


One shining moment through the air
It took three-and-half quarters for Ridder to throw a pass beyond 20 yards. The result couldn’t have gone any better. This is one of Smith’s classic deep play-action concepts using both his top two pass catchers. Instead of running a signature Yankee concept with London running the deep over route, Pitts decides to run more of a deep corner instead of a post. The inside coverage with safety help could have altered those plans.

That didn’t prevent Ridder from connecting with Pitts for a much-needed splash play to inject life into a non-existent passing game. Ridder knew the time was right to get aggressive and trust the star tight end to make a fantastic contested grab. It came to fruition.




Jessie Bates steals the show
It didn’t take long for the star safety to make his mark in Atlanta. After Bryce Young makes his first read to the right, he redirects his eyes toward the middle of the field. With tight man coverage across the field and Young beginning to stare down Hayden Hurst, the timing was perfect for Bates to pounce on a rookie mistake.

Playing two-high can provide more freedom for safeties to take chances and capitalize on quarterbacks staring down their intended target. Bates set the tone with his first interception by reading Young’s eyes and jumping right in front of Hurst to put the Falcons in excellent field position.



Bates capitalized on a common young quarterback mistake once again. Young stared down his intended target across the middle of the field even worse on this interception. Bates is lining up as a deep-lying safety in more of a robber look, which was common for him in Cincinnati, as Vonn Bell would play more near the box. Bates has outstanding instincts and range to flourish in coverage, covering acres of space on the back end. It didn’t take much for him to intercept the first overall pick for the second time.



Run defense woes
Besides an anemic four-man pass rush, the most concerning aspect for the defense coming out of the opening weekend was how they allowed Carolina to pick up consistent chunk plays on the ground. On too many occasions, gaps were opening up up front, and players couldn’t disengage from blocks.

To make matters worse, the linebackers found themselves out of position too often. Troy Andersen had difficulty maintaining gap control, while edge defenders like Bud Dupree failed to make stops when required to prevent big runs from occurring.



Carolina used duo to great success on multiple big runs. They were able to double Grady Jarrett and Daniel Onyemata in creating lanes for Miles Sanders or, in this instance, Chuba Hubbard. Frank Reich made it a point of emphasis to test Atlanta’s untested linebacker tandem of Anderson and Kaden Elliss. Neither player has had a full year of starting experience, which was concerning going into the season. They both endured their share of getting blocked out of runs, leading to chunk gains for the Panthers.



What also contributed to the defense allowing nearly five yards per carry was the rotational players being completely overwhelmed. Zach Harrison, Ta’Quon Graham, and Albert Huggins were frequently pushed around at the point of attack. This run particularly stood out for how poor Graham’s technique is and Harrison’s lack of gap discipline.

No defense can allow that much space for a running back. Hubbard goes untouched for more than ten yards, which is unacceptable. Nielsen has to be concerned about his defensive line rotation being overpowered by an average-at-best offensive line. Elliss’ failed attempt at shooting through the B-gap capped off a brutal play for the Falcons.



Run defense response
The defense did have some fine moments against the run, none greater than the fourth down stop on the first drive. For all the personnel changes, a few things remain certain with the Falcons. Grady Jarrett is going to wreck running plays. His blistering first step slanting into the a-gap forces Hubbard to hesitate.

In a short-yardage situation, the last thing a running back wants to do is be tentative with his decision-making. Hubbard has no choice after Jarrett’s penetration. From there, the defense pounced on Hubbard, led by Bud Dupree and Bates. It was a massive win for Nielsen’s defense in getting a strong push up front and having veteran players stay disciplined to finish their impressive work.



Despite his early struggles, Andersen did play well in the second half. He had several flashes where his impressive athleticism shined. The decisiveness to beat the interior blocks and burst into the backfield for a tackle for a loss is the type of play you want to see from a linebacker with his attributes. Jarrett’s ability to fight through multiple blocks, along with Calais Campbell overpowering Taylor Moton with sheer ferocity, makes this one of the standout defensive plays. This is how a defense only allows three points in the second half.



Third down success
Carolina converted five out of 14 third downs. They struggled mightily in the second half, having to punt three times after two consecutive drives ended in turnovers. The Falcons were outstanding in coverage all game long in a favorable matchup. A.J. Terrell didn’t break much of a sweat when isolated against Terrace Marshall in man coverage. The manner in which the four-man rush forced Young into an inaccurate throw was most notable.

After not generating any semblance of pressure in the first half, the front four started to rattle Young as the game wore on. This was one of the few plays Campbell lined up on the interior. Despite primarily lining up at the left edge position, the stellar defensive lineman can cause serious havoc on the interior with his length and power. It was evident by combining with Jarrett to collapse the pocket and help produce a third down stop.



Nielsen’s blitz magic
One of the Saints’ main advantages over teams in the past five years has been how they generate pressure. Nielsen played an instrumental role in applying these aggressive looks with both linebackers in front of the center. Instead of a standard double a-gap blitz, he uses twists from multiple angles to disrupt the quarterback.

Young knows he has to stand tall in the pocket with five rushers flying around. If he doesn’t get the ball out, he has no choice but to take a sack. Lorenzo Carter ends up being the beneficiary of this well-designed blitz by splitting multiple blockers to seal the win.



As satisfying as the previous sack was, the first sack of the game was even more impressive. It was needed with Adam Thielen roaming free on a drag route. They uniquely sent five rushers, with Andersen and Tre Flowers blitzing. The explosiveness that Andersen brings makes the difference by forcing Hubbard and Bradley Bozeman to block him.

That leaves a looping Dupree with a free shot on Young. Andersen ends up earning half of the sack for his excellent work, along with Jarrett’s relentless pursuit. A tremendous design from Nielsen leads to perfect execution for a game-changing third-down sack that started a dominant fourth quarter for the Falcons.


The Dallas Cowboys opened the 2023 season with an emphatic and historic 40-0 win over the New York Giants, starting the season off 1-0 for the first time since 2019.

The Cowboys made history with their 40-0 shutout against the Giants, the largest shutout in series history, beating out a 35-0 win set back in 1995.

The key to winning this game was getting off to an early start, and the Cowboys did this flawlessly, jumping out to a 16-0 first-quarter lead while keeping the Giants out of the end zone for the entire night.

All three cylinders were hitting throughout the entire game.

Highlights From The Dallas Cowboys vs. New York Giants
Highlights from the game included Juanyeh Thomas blocking a kick that ended in a scoop six for Noah Igbinoghene.


The game also saw Daron Bland with a pick-six off of a Trevon Diggs pass breakup.


We can’t forget Stephon Gilmore’s first interception of the game and as a member of the Cowboys.


Other highlights included Micah Parsons and Demarcus Lawrence each with one sack, and Osa Odighizuwa and Dorance Armstrong with two each. Additionally, Trevon Diggs forced a fumble from Isaiah Hodgins, which ended in a recovery by Israel Mukuamu.


The Cowboys Defense is Elite 
The talk of the game will be the level Dan Quinn’s defense continues to play at. 

The unit picked up right where they left off last season, recording seven sacks, two interceptions, and one forced fumble, continuously putting pressure on Daniel Jones throughout the night.

The seven sacks within the game were the second-most in a season opener in Cowboys’ team history, just behind the 1994 opener that had nine.


With the run defense being the unit’s downfall last season, all eyes were on the trenches. But the defensive line stuffed the trenches throughout the game, giving the Giants nowhere to go. The Giants had 108 rushing yards throughout the entire game, most when the game was out of reach.


The “Texas Coast” Offense Will Have Dak Prescott Playing His Best
Special teams and defense started the momentum early for the Cowboys, while it took the offense a little longer to shake off the rust.

Dak Prescott looked comfortable playing under Mike McCarthy’s play calling in the new “Texas Coast” offensive scheme.


Prescott surpassed 25,000 career passing yards after throwing for 91 in the first half. Prescott and Aaron Rodgers are now the only players in NFL history to accumulate 25,000 passing yards and 1,500 rushing yards in their first 100 career games.


Overall, the communication issues that plagued the Cowboys’ offense are becoming a subject of the past. Sunday’s game showed precisely why the offseason work to build chemistry has paid dividends.

If there is one thing to nitpick about, it would be Prescott’s completion percentage (54%). But considering this was the first game, he should warm up even more as the season continues.


The Cowboys Are Better Than They Were Last Season
This is an obvious statement; the level they played in week one of the season, with the starters having no preseason playing time, is worth discussing.

With many unknowns going into this game, the bar has been set for what this team can do if they all remain healthy.


Tony Pollard stepped into the starting running back role Sunday night and had 70 yards on 14 attempts with two touchdowns.

KaVontae Turpin also found himself in the end zone for a touchdown during mop-up work.


The young tight end room showed out not only as receiving threats but also played a huge role in blocking throughout the night. But dropped balls could be a point of emphasis for them over the next week.

COMMENT
Brandon Aubrey duck-hooked an extra point. Tony Pollard coughed up a fumble. And those rain-soaked rubber pellets sticking to players' faces looked like giant freckles, or maybe even leeches. But ... who are we kidding? Even the nit-pickiest of critics couldn't find anything wrong with the Dallas Cowboys' 40-0 dismantling of the New York Giants. It is, for crying out loud, the most impressive opener in franchise history.

It's the Cowboys' largest shutout victory in team history, eclipsing the defending Super Bowl XII champs starting the 1978 season with a 38-0 blanking of the Baltimore Colts. It is also their largest victory over the Giants since a 52-7 shellacking at the Cotton Bowl to open the 1966 season. 

As they say in New York, when it rains ... it pours.

10. DEJA BLUE - This blowout was reminiscent of a Cowboys' prime-time opener that led to a Super Bowl almost 30 years ago. On Sept. 5, 1995 in then-Giants Stadium, the Cowboys throttled New York 35-0 on Monday Night Football. Emmitt Smith took his first hand-off 60 yards for a score and Dallas never really looked back, winning Super Bowl XXX five months later. In the late stages of that game, Jerry Jones frolicked on the fourth-quarter sideline with Nike czar Phil Knight and tennis star Monica Seles. Pretty sure Jerry stayed in his owner's suite Sunday night, but an early 26-0 lead and cakewalk victory likely provided him nostalgic vibes.


9. GIANT ADVANTAGE - In their last 12 season openers, the Cowboys have played the Giants seven times. Despite the lack of creativity from the NFL schedule makers - America's Team + America's Biggest TV market = boffo ratings - you won't hear much complaining from Dallas. It is now 6-1 in those games (10-1 all-time in openers vs. New York), including 2-0 on the road. That's seven openers against the Giants since 2012, compared to the last Week 1 matchup against Washington in 2010 and vs. the Eagles way back in 2000.


8. SHOCK BLOCK - The Giants drove the field on their opening possession and seemed poised to take an early lead. But on 3rd-and-2 from Dallas' 8-yard line, the wheels completely came off. A false-start penalty and a bad shotgun snap forced them to settle for a 45-yard field goal attempt. But Cowboys' safety Juanyeh Thomas hopped between to blockers and easily blocked Graham Gano's kick. Cornerback Noah Igbinoghene scooped the ball and - aided by a Thomas block - scampered untouched 58 yards for a touchdown and an abrupt swing of momentum that changed the game radically, and permanently.


7. SPEED KILLS - For us old-timers, the Cowboys appeared to be playing at 78rpm and the Giants at 33rpm. For the young-uns, New York played in real time while Dallas swooshed past them at "FFx8." At times the defensive line seemed to be running pass-rush drills around merely blocking dummies. The Cowboys finished with seven sacks of beleaguered Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones.


6. DAK APPLE - As a rookie in 2016, Dak Prescott lost both his starts against the Giants. But he hasn’t been defeated by them since. Prescott has now beaten the Giants 11 consecutive games, throwing for 23 touchdowns against only seven interceptions in the process. Only other Cowboys quarterback to beat the Giants in 11 straight: fella named Roger Staubach.

5. 'ROOKIE' REVIEW - Both of Dallas' key newcomers paid early dividends, as cornerback Stephon Gilmore had an interception of Jones to set up a second-quarter touchdown and two pass breakups, while receiver Brandin Cooks drew a 37-yard pass-interference penalty and made two catches for 22 yards.

4. OFFSEASON OVERRATED? - NFL teams (especially coaches) are so enamored with players being at team facilities year-round. Offseason programs. OTAs. Minicamps. Training camps. Preseason. Gotta build camaraderie, and a close-knight culture. Right? Or ... you can get traded, join a new club and - just 12 days later - score the team's first touchdown of the season. Igbinoghene did just that, returning a blocked field goal for a score after arriving from the Miami Dolphins in a trade for Kelvin Joseph on Aug. 29.


3. SCRIPT, FLIPPED - This was a slightly better performance than a year ago when the Cowboys debuted on Sunday Night Football. In that debacle, they lost 19-3 to the Buccaneers and Prescott suffered a fractured thumb that sidelined him for five games. In this one, the Cowboys produced four sacks, two takeaways and a blocked field goal in a dominant first half and then coasted the rest of the way. Crazy game, this football. In last year's opening loss, Prescott threw for 134 yards. In this year's opening romp: 143.


2. TAKEAWAY TEMPLATE - Seems iffy to count on a plethora of takeaways as a blueprint for defensive success, but Dan Quinn's unit of ballhawks is picking right up where it left off the last two seasons. After leading the league with 34 in 2021 and another 33 last year, the Cowboys created three more turnovers in the opener. Not known for his tackling, cornerback Trevon Diggs launched a perfectly placed shoulder into the chest of Saquon Barkley to force a deflection that DaRon Bland plucked out of the air for a 22-yard interception return for a touchdown and a 16-0 lead. Diggs later stripped Giants' receiver Isaiah Hodgins for a fumble recovered by Israel Mukuamu.


1. VICTORY VIA VARIETY - The odds had to be astronomical, but on a rainy night in Jersey the stars on the Cowboys helmets aligned. The first two touchdowns of the season were scored on special teams and defense, a first in the franchise's 64-year history.



AT A GLANCE

A blocked field goal returned for a touchdown and a defensive score put the New York Giants behind out of the gate en route to a 40-0 shutout loss to the Dallas Cowboys to open the season.

UP NEXT

The Giants will regroup and hit the road for two weeks with back-to-back NFC West matchups against the Cardinals and 49ers. Arizona opened the season with a 20-16 loss to Washington as the Giants were the lone NFC East team to fall in Week 1.

WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE OFFENSE

🏈 The Giants' final injury report of the week included a significant name. Tight end Darren Waller, who was not previously on the report, was listed as questionable with a hamstring injury. Waller was limited in practiced for the first time on Friday, but the marquee offseason addition was active for Sunday night. Waller caught three passes for 36 yards in his Giants debut.

🏈 On Friday, in his last session with the media before the game, Daboll said the Giants had settled on their two starting guards, which had been a rotation throughout the summer. He just didn't disclose who they would be. On Sunday night, it was Ben Bredeson on the left and Mark Glowinski on the right. In between was rookie center John Michael Schmitz Jr., while Andrew Thomas and Evan Neal manned the edges.

🏈 The first-team offense had just one drive in the preseason, and it was nearly flawless. It looked like the starters had picked up where they left off to start the regular season, marching down to Cowboys 13 on the first drive of the game. But that's where Sunday night went sideways. A low snap by Schmitz on third-and-seven led to a 14-yard loss. It got worse on the next play, a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown.

🏈 After a three-and-out, the third drive ended in a pick-six, with cornerback DaRon Bland grabbing a pass that went off the hands of Saquon Barkley and returning it 22 yards for a touchdown. Former NFL Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore also intercepted Jones, who last year had the lowest interception rate (1.1 percent of attempts) in the NFL.

🏈 Jones, who ran a career-high (regular season) 13 times for 43 yards, was under duress for much of the night. The Cowboys sacked him four times on seven quarterback hits in the first half alone. Overall, he was sacked seven times while Dallas registered 12 quarterback hits.

🏈 Wide receiver Isaiah Hodgins lost a fumble on a 24-yard pickup, bringing the Giants' turnover total to three for the game.

🏈 Wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson has not played since tearing his ACL last Nov. 20 vs. Detroit. Robinson was activated off the reserve/physically unable to perform list on Aug. 29. He has since participated in practice but was limited.

WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE DEFENSE

🏈 The defense was put behind the eight ball as the Giants found themselves down 16-0 in the first quarter thanks to the Cowboys' defensive and special teams scores. While they gave up three rushing touchdowns – two to Tony Pollard – they limited Dak Prescott to just 143 passing yards as Dallas played with the lead for nearly the entire night.

🏈 A major storyline this summer was the rookie cornerback tandem of Deonte Banks, a first-round pick, and Tre Hawkins III, a sixth-rounder. Banks broke up two passes but was penalized for illegal contact on a Cowboys touchdown drive. The Maryland product then went into the locker room at halftime as he dealt with cramps.

🏈 Hawkins flashed his physicality among seven tackles but was called for a 37-yard passing interference penalty on a third-and-long, leading to a Dallas field goal.

🏈 Heading into the game, defensive lineman D.J. Davidson (knee) and linebacker Cam Brown (ankle) were listed as questionable. Cornerback Cor'Dale Flott (hamstring) and rookie safety Gervarrius Owens (hamstring) were doubtful. All four were inactive on Sunday night.

WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT SPECIAL TEAMS

🏈 You knew it wasn't the Giants' night when kicker Graham Gano wasn't automatic. Gano, whose 91.8 percent success rate was the highest in Giants history among kickers with at least 50 attempts heading into the season, was unsuccessful on his first two field goal attempts.

The first, a 45-yard try, was blocked by safety Juanyeh Thomas and returned 58 yards for a touchdown by cornerback Noah Igbinoghene. Gano's next attempt, a 36-yarder, missed wide left on a wet night in East Rutherford. Two days before the season began, Gano signed a three-year contract extension that will begin in the 2024 season.

The Jacksonville Jaguars are back and looking better than ever.

The Jaguars enjoyed their first opening week victory since 2020 on Sunday following an exhilarating 31-21 performance against the Indianapolis Colts. The Jaguars eventually shined in all three phases of the game despite a strong start from the Colts’ defensive line and an impressive debut from rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson.

The offense met or exceeded just about every expectation set for them with nearly 350 total yards and four scores. The connection between quarterback Trevor Lawrence and wideout Calvin Ridley appears to be, as predicted, scorching-hot right out of the gates as the pair produced a touchdown and 101 yards through the air.

The Jaguars defense dominated as well, holding the short-handed Colts to just two offensive touchdowns on their 14 drives. The team recorded four sacks and forced three turnovers as multiple familiar names had strong showings. The pass-rush tandem of Trevon Walker and Josh Allen outclassed Indianapolis’ front five, while cornerback Tyson Campbell had one of his best games as a professional.

On special teams kicks were sure and returners were timely as the unit stepped up big late in the game to help put this one away for Jacksonville. Kicker Brandon McManus silenced much of the noise surrounding his departure from Denver this offseason, and punter Logan Cooke was launching footballs as usual.

With so many players having crucial roles in yesterday’s win, it only feels right to reaffirm that the game balls handed out here don’t mean others didn’t play exceptional as well. With that, three Jaguars truly stood out from the crowd against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday -- three you may be very familiar with.

Offense: WR Calvin Ridley
Are you not entertained?


The Colts’ secondary certainly wasn’t after Ridley’s debut with the Jaguars, and if you played him in fantasy like I did it definitely left a sour aftertaste. In his first game since the suspension that sidelined him for over a year, the fifth-year veteran made a statement with eight catches for over 100 receiving yards and a touchdown; the team’s first of the new campaign.


On the team’s second drive Ridley had already collected three balls in the span of five plays when Lawrence hit him right in the chest in the endzone for the aforementioned score. Looking Ridley’s way when the play broke down became commonplace throughout the contest for the third-year Clemson product, who targeted the former Falcon 11 times.

It appears as though he hasn’t lost a single step, as he easily dominated a lack-luster Colts secondary as the team’s primary option. Sunday confirmed what the Jaguars have known all summer; Calvin Ridley is not only a true number one wide receiver, he is one of most dynamic playmakers in the entire NFL.


Defense: EDGE Josh Allen
It’s hard to remember Josh Allen having a better game donning the teal and gold for good reason; he hasn’t had one.

The former Kentucky Wildcat had a monster performance; he tied his career-best mark in tackles with ten total, and set a new one in sacks with three. He poured on an additional three tackles for loss and two quarterback hits to make a convincing case for AFC Defensive Player of the Week.


Allen, like Ridley, had something to say on Sunday after failing to be named a team captain for the first time in his professional career. He responded with a performance that landed him the lead in sacks across the league, tied with the likes of T.J. Watt and Drake Jackson, and he's got all the ingredients for a breakout season that’s already well underway.


Josh Allen has set a new standard for himself at the onset of his fourth season, and one that the organization hopes will continue to result in box scores like yesterday’s.

Special Teams: PR Jamaal Agnew
Despite solid showings from both McManus and Cooke, it was Jamaal Agnew who made the biggest plays on special teams for the Jaguars on Sunday.


Trailing 21-17 with eleven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Agnew received a Colts punt on his own 6-yard line. The starting offense took the field on Indianapolis' 46 thanks to a 48-yard return from the seventh-year man, his second return of 20 yards or more against the Colts.

Following Agnew’s crucial return, the offense drove down the field and punched in the score that would give them the lead for the remainder of the contest. Without Agnew’s fourth-quarter heroics, this game likely ends much differently.



Week one is in the books and our Indianapolis Colts have played their first game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Even though things didn’t go the way we hoped it was great to have Colts football back and there were absolutely positives from the days activities. It’s important to remember teams that start rookie quarterbacks almost never win a lot of games and well, we might be on our way join the lot of teams who finish that way. But let’s take a look at the highs (and some of the lows) of the week and then it will be on to the Houston Texans in week two.

First Quarter
1 for 1


We’ll just get it out of the way Anthony Richardson finished 24-37 for 223 yards 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He also had 10 carries for 40 yards and another touchdown. He played as well as any rookie did this afternoon. In fact all three teams that took quarterbacks with top five picks, lost. The Colts were the only team of the three to score more than 10 points. But Richardson played like a rookie. He looked good, he looked bad, he looked young. It’s going to take time but there’s plenty to be excited about.

This Colts defense is a gift for a young QB


This was a consistent sight for much of the game. That said there’s only so much either side of the ball can do without help from the offense, eventually the dam will break and we’ll get to that later.

Josh Downs looked very promising.


Richardson and Downs connected early and often. Downs finished the game with just three catches for 30 yards but it seems like the foundation is there for the two to continue to produce for the rest of the season.

Second Quarter

On the first play of the second quarter of his first NFL game, Anthony Richardson scored his first career touchdown. Nice play.

The defense really came to play


The Colts defensive line was in the backfield all day long and seemingly every positive play that happened could be directly attributed to them. As the offense comes along, this Colts team is going to be formidable over the second half of the season.

Kwity Paye with a sack


Paye made a couple of nice plays in this one and this was the first sack of the 2023 season for the Indianapolis Colts.

Third Quarter
Richardson’s First Career TD Pass:


Haters are going to look at this and point out that his first touchdown came on a screen pass and his receiver did most of the work. And to that I say: yeah, so?

Sometimes it happens like that. Peyton Manning’s first touchdown was a six yard pass with less than 10 seconds left on the clock in a blowout. How and when it happened, really doesn’t matter. It happened. He threw a pass, he did his job and his teammates did their jobs, and when it was all said and done, it scored six points.

This has to be the craziest play of the day


So DeForest Buckner gets a strip sack, Jags running back Cartavious Bigsby picks up what everyone seemed to believe was a dead ball. Zaire Franklin, being one of like three players with a functioning brain on the field at that moment realized there was no whistle, came up and forced a second fumble on the same play by punching the ball out, then Buckner the guy who started this madness picks up the ball and decides if no one else is going to do it, he’ll just score a touchdown himself.

And just like that, the Colts were winning the game.

Fourth Quarter
Of everything that happened today, this is the singular play that could be most blamed for the loss


A few plays later the Jags punched in a touchdown to take back a lead they wouldn’t give up.

Yes, this sucks, but it’s not the end of the world.


Anthony Richardson was given the ball, down by three with just over five minutes to go in the fourth quarter of his very first NFL game. We all would have liked this to have a storybook ending. We all had that thought, I know I did; “this kid’s going to march down the field and go get a win in his first NFL game”. But then reality set in.

The reality is, he just turned 21 years old. He only started 13 games in college. He had every excuse to go out and look completely lost and yet he made most of the plays he needed to make, most of the day. He looked like he belonged. He played as well as the other rookie quarterbacks, the same guys who were billed as “more ready to play” than him (don’t look now but Bryce Young went 20-38 for 146 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions).


The reality is, this isn’t a storybook. Anthony Richardson is further along than most people seemed to think (not me, but that’s not the point). He played well, he made mistakes, he did exactly what we all should have expected him to do. I get it, the game itself ended in a frustrating way, but in context, it went better than we should have expected.

Ballgame


If you apply pressure long enough, eventually the dam will break and it finally happened late in the fourth quarter. This touchdown put this one on ice for the Colts.

Final Thoughts on Week One
I’ve seen a lot of people talk about how conservative Shane Steichen’s offense was this week. A lot of people have pointed out that it was likely because he was protecting Richardson. While that might be true to an extent, the other part of it is the fact that the Jags defense lives with two safeties deep. They force opposing quarterbacks to take underneath throws. The coverages they use don’t just force rookie quarterbacks to take underneath routes, it’s the same type of coverage shell that Patrick Mahomes had so much trouble with (because he just didn’t want to take his check downs).

So the game plan was probably somewhat conservative but the Jags defense lives to limit the deep ball. They do some different things in other places but their overall philosophy to the deep ball is similar to the Matt Eberflus Colts defense- they just don’t want it to happen, ever.

Anthony Richardson missed some throws today. We knew he was going to. But he made the layups and played within the offense. He needs time. We need to be patient. The deep ball will come. So will the wins. There will be better days ahead and there will be far, far worse days too. Today was just the first day. The future looks bright, as long as we can convince Anthony to stop taking big shots. He’s big, he can take some but nobody’s invincible.

Get ready for Houston. The Colts can win it. They should win it.



Head Coach Doug Pederson Recognizes Imperfections in Jaguars' Week 1 Win: The Day After Analysis

The Day After - 2
JACKSONVILLE – This wasn't perfect, and that was expected.

Head Coach Doug Pederson a day after a victory in the 2023 regular-season opener called the Jaguars "still a work in progress," which is fine if there is improvement moving forward.

"It was good to get the win, but overall, we have some corrections to make," Pederson said Monday, a day after the Jaguars’ 31-21 victory over the Indianapolis Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. "We have to get better. Communication has to get better.

"We're working on those this week.

The Jaguars rallied from a four-point fourth-quarter deficit Sunday, with running backs Tank Bigsby and Travis Etienne rushing for fourth-quarter touchdowns and the defense holding the Colts' offense scoreless for the final 26:25. The victory put the Jaguars alone in first place in the AFC South at 1-0, with the other three division teams – the Tennessee Titans, Colts and Houston Texans – losing in Week 1.

"It's hard to win in this league," said wide receiver Zay Jones, whose 18-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Trevor Lawrence gave the Jaguars a 14-7 second-quarter lead Sunday. "You go into those types of environments, with their fan base, they have a lot of energy surrounding their quarterback and the team they're building. To get that win means a lot to us.

"You're going to have to put those things to bed and have a short monitor. You have to move onto Kansas City now, which is another really good football team."

The Jaguars will play host to the defending Super Bowl and AFC West Champion Kansas City Chiefs at EverBank Stadium Sunday. The Jaguars lost twice in Kansas City last season – 27-17 in the regular season and 27-20 in an AFC Divisional Playoff game.

"It's a different animal," Pederson said. "It's a veteran quarterback (Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs). It's a Super Bowl-winning team. They're obviously well-coached [by Head Coach Andy Reid]. It's a disciplined group. The challenges are real. We haven't fared so well against them, especially last year. It's a great opportunity for our team. It's a home game. We're looking forward to the challenge, game-planning this week."

BRANDON TODD/JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS
The Chiefs have won the last seven meetings between the teams. with Pederson never having won against Reid in three meetings – two last season and one while Pederson was the Philadelphia Eagles' head coach in 2017.


"We've got to try to work on that," Pederson said.

Pederson on Monday said he was disappointed in the team's third- and fourth-down conversions, with the offense converting three of 12 third downs and one of three on fourth downs. He said he would have expected a rate in the 60-to-70 percent range considering the Jaguars averaged needing four yards on third downs.

"Those are all opportunities," he said. "Those are things we'll take a look at and have to fix."

Pederson said he was pleased overall with a defense that registered four sacks, three turnovers and stopped the Colts on four of five fourth-down attempts.

"I thought the defense played well," he said. "They controlled the line of scrimmage. I just thought that the defense really kind of kept the offense in the football game."

QUOTABLE

Pederson: "Week 1's not going to decide your season at all. How many times have you seen teams jump out four, five, six-and-oh then falter in December and January? You want to be one of the teams that are going the other direction in December and January."
NOTABLE

Pederson on Monday again addressed offensive coordinator Press Taylor handling play-calling this season. Pederson called plays in the first half of games in 2022, with Taylor calling plays in second halves. Pederson confirmed the news of the change following Sunday's victory. "Press and I have been talking about this for two years now, and it's something I've thought a lot about," Pederson said. "It's not an easy decision without a lot of conversation and just he and I talking about it. He and I have been together now seven years. We kind of know each other. I trust him wholeheartedly. That's why he's my offensive coordinator. He makes good decisions. He's well prepared. It gives me an opportunity to stay engaged within the game and decision-making in the game and help out all three phases a little bit more and deal with officials. It's not easy, but at the same time, I felt like this was the right opportunity."
NOTABLE

Pederson said X-Rays and MRIs Monday showed veteran right guard Brandon Scherff sustained an ankle sprain Sunday. "He'll be tender the next couple of days," Pederson said. "We'll keep monitoring him the next couple of days as we go through." Pederson added, "It's obviously a loss for the offensive line, pretty substantial. If he can't, we're confident. [Veteran guard/center] Shatley filled in well. He's a veteran guy who knows the system. We have all the confidence in the world we'll have the answers there."



he Buffalo Bills opened their 2023 campaign with a disastrous 22-16 loss to the New York Jets. Here is Bills Wire’s analysis and recap of Buffalo’s disappointing performance in East Rutherford:

Game recap

Buffalo Bills defensive end Leonard Floyd (56) USAT

The much-hyped opening game between AFC East divisional foes saw a shocking shift of emotions throughout the entire evening. The Bills offense opened with a disappointing five-play drive, culminating in a punt.

On New York’s first drive of the season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers left with an injury after only four plays. The veteran quarterback was sacked by Leonard Floyd, and the Jets’ massive offseason addition was off the field in a matter of moments.

The Bills offense finally made some progress, only to be denied just outside of the red zone.  Buffalo rattled off an 11-play drive that stalled out at the Jets 22-yard line. Jets defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers sacked Allen, putting the Bills in a tough third-down position. In the end, Allen couldn’t lead his team further, leading to a Tyler Bass 40-yard field goal.

The roller coaster ride continued for Buffalo, as Allen forced a deep pass downfield. Jordan Whitehead intercepted his first of three Allen passes on the evening. Still, Buffalo’s defense kept things under control, forcing the Jets to settle for a field goal to tie the game.

Buffalo’s offense looked like they were about the turn the corner, as Allen led the Bills offense on an 11-play, 75-yard drive. Allen rolled out to his right and delivered a pass to Stefon Diggs in the corner of the end zone to give Buffalo a 10-3 lead.

The Bills defense would once again make a big play, with Matt Milano intercepting Zach Wilson. However, Buffalo’s offense could only muster a field goal in response. Even so, the Bills entered halftime with a 10-point lead.

The second half was a time of horrors for Allen. He turned the ball over three more times, with two more interceptions by Whitehead and a lost fumble.

The Jets methodically worked their way back into the game. New York wideout Garrett Wilson made a fantastic juggling catch to give the Jets their first touchdown of the season.

While Buffalo’s offense stalled, the Jets continued to grind out yards on the ground. Breece Hall and Delvin Cook slowly carved up the Bills defense. While the New York offense was far from dynamic, it did enough to keep the Jets in it.

The Jets took their first lead of the game just after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. The Jets made several conservative play calls to put them in position to take a three-point lead.

Down 16-13, Buffalo’s offense showed a spark of life.

The unit was forced to play quickly and decisively. Allen, despite his struggles throughout the second half, pulled it together to drive the Bills offense into field goal range.

Bass upheld his end of the bargain with the dramatics, narrowly making a 49-yard game-tying field. The kick clanged off the goal post and cleared the bar.

Buffalo took possession of the ball in overtime but proceeded to go three-and-out. In improbable fashion, Jets punt returner Xavier Gipson returned Sam Martin’s low line-drive punt 65 yards to the end zone for the victory.

Allen’s four turnovers effectively stunted any sort of meaningful progress for the offense. Allen threw three egregious interceptions. He followed those with a mess of a fumble, one which put the Jets in an ideal position to tie the game.
The Jets found success on the ground. New York ran for 172 yards on 28 carries. Hall was stellar in his return to the field, rushing 10 times for 127 yards. Hall had a sensational 86-yard scamper that completely flipped the field for New York.
Buffalo’s defense kept Wilson under wraps. Wilson threw for only 140 yards on a 14-of-21 passing day. Even so, Wilson managed the game and put New York in a position to win. His lone turnover led to only three points by Buffalo’s offense.
The Jets defense, for the second consecutive year, gave Buffalo’s offense fits. Outside of Diggs and a few plays by James Cook, the Buffalo offense looked sluggish. The offense line had issues with protecting Allen. In turn, Allen forced several passes, which became turnovers.
Sam Martin’s final punt lacked the hang time to allow the coverage unit to effectively bottle up Gipson. The unit looked out of sorts as Gipson weaved his way for the game-winning score.

Game balls

It’s not exciting to give game balls following a loss. However, there were a few standouts:

Stefon Diggs–10 catches, 102 yards, 1 touchdown reception
Tyler Bass–three-for-three on field goals, including the 49-yarder to tie the game with two seconds remaining in regulation
Leonard Floyd–three tackles, 1.5 sacks

What happened?

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) USAT

Buffalo’s offense never seemed quite comfortable throughout the game. The Bills started with a quick passing attack to neutralize the Jets defensive attack. However, this advantage largely went away as the Jets put more pressure on the Bills offense line.

Allen’s turnovers were alarming. He was pressing throughout the game and reverted back to some hero ball tendencies. The interceptions were horrendous decisions, almost as if nothing would go wrong once the ball left Allen’s hands.

It became a snowball effect. The line struggled; Allen struggled; the team struggled.

Some blame falls on Ken Dorsey as well. The playcalling did not fit what would most effectively deal with the Jets superior front four. The lack of a run game in addition to the inability to consistently get the ball into the skill players’ hands is quite a problem that needs to be solved in four days.

What's next?

How is Josh Allen different going into year 6? His teammates, coaches answer

The New York Jets have some heavy lifting to do on Monday night with the three-time defending division champions in town for the season opener at MetLife Stadium.

Despite their last-place finish, the Jets matched up well with the Buffalo Bills in 2022.

Robert Saleh's team limited Buffalo's high-octane offense to 37 combined points over a two-game span. During a 20-17 win in Week 9, Gang Green's defense held superstar quarterback Josh Allen in check to the tune of a 46.8 passer rating. It was Allen's lowest single-game rating of the season. In the second head-to-head battle, a 20-12 Bills' victory in Buffalo, the Jets held Allen to a season-low 147 pass yards.


This year, the Jets are expected to pack more punch on offense with the Aaron Rodgers Era kicking off on Monday Night Football. Meanwhile, the Green & White defense welcomes back All-Pro talent at each level as it aims to improve last season's fourth overall ranking.

Here are three keys that, collectively, could unlock a Jets' win during what promises to be an emotionally-charged night on September 11 in East Rutherford.


Keep the Heat on Allen
The Bills' starting signal caller can beat a defense using his arm or legs. With Allen's ability to make good things happen on the run after the play breaks down, the Jets pass rush has to get home. 

"He has the ability to improvise and extend plays and make magic on those second plays, so it’s a great challenge. It’s a great barometer for this defense and where we’re at to play a high-level opponent like this," said Jets' defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich.


Gang Green's defensive line delivered numerous notable hits, highlighted by eight sacks, on Allen during the two 2022 meetings. 

The Jets' fifth, and final, sack in the November win resulted in an UCL injury for the Bills' field general. Bryce Huff blew past Buffalo left tackle Dion Dawkins and knocked the ball out of Allen's throwing hand in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter. 


"Our defensive line is one to be reckoned with in my opinion. Not only do we have very good players, we have a lot of depth," said Jeff Ulbrich.

The Jets' deep defensive line rotation should pose problems for a number of opponents this season and their performance will have a lot to say about Buffalo's Week 1 offensive output. 


"Their defensive line is outstanding. That’ll be a big challenge for us," said Bills' seventh-year head coach Sean McDermott.


Stick with the Run
The Jets already had Breece Hall but went out and added four-time Pro Bowl running back Dalvin Cook. They have the horses needed for an effective rushing attack and they should heavily rely on the run against Buffalo in Week 1. 


Establishing a ground game will take heat off Rodgers and open up some appealing play-action looks in the pass game. It also gives the Jets a chance to control the clock, keeping Allen and his weapons on the sideline.

The Bills' defense could prove susceptible to a formidable rushing attack due to the fact that they have prioritized speed over size. Linebackers Matt Milano and Terrel Bernard are both under 225 pounds. Buffalo employs only two backers in its base defensive formation which features slot cornerback Taron Johnson, whose role requires great responsibility against the run.


The Jets may also want to test a Bills' run defense in its first game since losing middle linebacker Tremaine Edmunds in free agency. Bernard, a 2022 second-round draft pick, will start in place of Edmunds.

Defending Buffalo's TE Duo
The Jets' defense appeared susceptible to the over-the-middle pass last season and the Bills will likely try to attack that area of the field by deploying tight ends Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid. 

Knox, who made a touchdown catch against the Jets last December, will fill more of a traditional tight end role.

Meanwhile, Kincaid, a first-round rookie, projects as more of a slot receiving option that an in-line tight end. Kincaid has already taken on a nickname of "Swole" Beasley in reference to Bills' former slot WR Cole Beasley.

"They added a tight end in the draft that is pretty darn good," said Jets' boss Robert Saleh.

With Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis occupying Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed on the outside of the formation, Allen may opt for shorter gains in the middle.

The Jets feature two new, inexperienced starters at linebacker and free safety with Jamien Sherwood and Tony Adams combining for only 143 defensive snaps in 2022. They'll be key to stopping Knox and Kincaid on Monday night.

The Detroit Lions proved that the hype is real in the Motor City after going into Arrowhead Stadium and taking down the defending Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs. Jared Goff had 253 yards and a TD, but it was rookie Bruce Branch’s pick six that made the difference in the Lions 21-20 win. 

Goff and St. Brown's special connection
The Lions landed the first blow after Dan Campbell went into his bag of tricks early in the game. Detroit faked a punt on 4th and 2 from inside their own 20 and that sparked a touchdown drive that was capped off with a nine yard Amon-Ra St. Brown catch to put the visitors on the board first. 

The Chiefs would respond, led by their reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes, but they were without the heart and soul of their offense, Travis Kelce who hyperextended his knee earlier in the week. Mahomes and KC took a quarter to get the wheels moving but a one yard TD pass to Rashee Rice tied the game up early in the second quarter. 

Mahomes would put the Chiefs in the lead right before the half with a six play, 83 yard drive that ended with a sidearm sling to Blake Bell to give the home side a 14-7 advantage with under a minute to go in the second quarter. 

Mahomes first INT in season opener
The Chiefs seemed to be in control after the late TD to end the first half, and getting possession to start the third quarter. Mahomes had his team moving down the field, but a disastrous night for Kadrius Toney was highlighted by his dropped ball that led to a Bruce Branch pick six to tie the game up early in the third quarter.  

The interception, even though he had nothing to do with it, was Mahomes’ first in a season opening game. He went into Thursday night with 18 TD passes and 0 INTs. The Chiefs offense came to a stand still with no Kelce, and they had to settle for just two Harrison Butker field goals in the second half which put them up 20-14 momentarily. 

On the following possession David Montgomery would lead his team down the field on a long drive that chewed up some clock and eventually put the Lions in the drivers seat. Montgomery punched the ball in from eight yards out in his Detroit debut and put the visitors up 21-20. 

Lions hype is real
The Chiefs had a couple different cracks at tying the game back up, but would go three on out on their next series, and turn it over on downs in four plays on their final series. 

There has been a lot of talk about this Detroit Lions squad after they won 8 of their last 10 to finish off last season. This win will only increase the hype around this team in the Motor City.

Going into Arrowhead and coming out with a win is never an easy things. Sometimes you have to go deep into your playbook to come up with a surprise or two to keep the defending champs on their toes. Dan Campbell went for it on 4th and 2 inside his own 20 in the first quarter, and the Lions would scored the first TD of the game as a result.

Lions upset Chiefs 21-20 in opening game of 2023 NFL season
The Detroit Lions defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 21-20 on Thursday night in the opening game of the 2023 season. Here’s what you need to know:

Detroit quarterback Jared Goff was 22-for-35 for 253 yards and one touchdown. Running back David Montgomery rushed for 74 yards and a touchdown.
The Lions opened the scoring after converting on a fake punt from their own 17-yard line with 9:27 left in the first quarter. Ten plays later Goff found receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for a 9-yard score.
Detroit rookie safety Brian Branch had a pick-six against Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes with 10:54 left in the third. The Lions later scored on an 8-yard rush by Montgomery with 7:03 left in the game to go up 21-20.
Mahomes — who was 21-for-39 for 226 yards, two touchdowns and one interception — suffered his first loss in six career opening-week games. The Chiefs were without star tight end Travis Kelce (knee inflammation) and defensive tackle Chris Jones (contract holdout).

Chiefs receivers drop the ball
They didn’t expect to feel this way. This was supposed to be another celebration of their continued excellence. On another national TV stage, this time on the NFL’s opening night, they would show they still have all the important people necessary — a future Hall of Fame coach, the sport’s best quarterback and a talented young supporting cast — to remain the league’s No. 1 team.

Yet the Kansas City Chiefs left their quiet locker room late Thursday night disappointed in themselves.

The scoreboards at Arrowhead Stadium displayed the league’s first result of the 2023 season: Detroit Lions 21, Chiefs 20.

For the first time in his seven-year career, quarterback Patrick Mahomes experienced what it’s like to lose the season’s first game. Playing without All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce and All-Pro defensive tackle Chris Jones, the Chiefs had their eight-year streak of starting the season with a victory snapped. They had averaged 36.3 points in those games.

“Anytime I lose, I’m embarrassed,” Mahomes said. “We’ve got to be better.”

Lions set tone for 2023 with win over Chiefs
Inside the NFL’s loudest stadium, on a night the defending Super Bowl champs raised a banner and kicked off a new season as the league’s gold standard, the home crowd fell eerily silent. With less than a minute to go, the Red Sea departed, heading for the exits. This was not the night they had anticipated.

Left amid the aftermath was an upstart Detroit Lions team, lining up for victory formation and a victory lap. All offseason, they told us this was different. That they were building a core capable of not only going toe-to-toe with the best in the league — but coming out on top.

You’ll have to excuse them for saying they told you so.

“I didn’t learn anything,” Lions head coach Dan Campbell said following his team’s 21-20 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. “I got verification of what I already knew.”

It feels so long ago now, when Campbell didn’t know what he had. It was a process of trial and error. Finding the right fits. Trying to establish an identity. Taking their medicine along the way, as GM Brad Holmes put it last week. But Campbell and everyone in this Lions organization feel confident in their ability to win games like this because of what they went through.

Great win for the Lions, but it only gets tougher from here
Of the 15 teams to start 1-0 last season (Colts and Texans tied), five of them went on to miss the playoffs including three teams that finished with a losing record. The Bears, which beat the 49ers in a driving rainstorm, went on to finish with the worst record in the league.

Teams to start 1-0 last season that missed playoffs

Steelers: 9-8
Commanders: 8-8-1
Browns: 7-10
Saints: 7-10
Bears: 3-14
On the other side of things, four teams that started 0-1 went on to reach the playoffs last season -- 49ers, Bengals, Cowboys and Jaguars -- and all four won at least one playoff game.

Drops prove costly for Chiefs
Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes knew he was starting this season under adverse circumstances. His best pass catcher, All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce, was forced to miss the game after he hyperextended one of his knees, a non-contact injury that occurred in Tuesday’s practice. But Mahomes, as he often does when facing adversity, produced another memorable performance, one that should’ve been enough to lead the Chiefs to a victory. But Mahomes was let down by his other skill-position teammates.

In total, the Chiefs unofficially finished with eight drops — four from receiver Kadarious Toney, two from receiver Skyy Moore, one from running back Jerick McKinnon and one from rookie receiver Rashee Rice. The game’s turning point proved to be when Mahomes, midway in the third quarter, threw a perfect pass to Toney, who was running a crossing route. Instead of catching the ball, Toney’s drop led to defensive back Brian Branch’s interception, a turnover he returned for a 50-yard touchdown.

The Lions used timely plays -- a fake punt to extend an eventual scoring drive, a Brian Branch pick-six and a key fourth-quarter drive -- to defeat Kansas City. Travis Kelce or not, this was a hostile environment. The Lions weren't fazed and got it done when it mattered most.

The Lions started off 1-6 a year ago, in part, because they couldn't finish games. That changed in the second half of the season, as a young Lions team learned how to win. Detroit went 8-2 in its final 10 games, but the biggest question coming into the year was would that second-half run continue. Against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in Week 1, the Lions did just that. They were the better team in a decisive fourth quarter. The defense held strong down the stretch, the offense did just enough to win and the Lions will return to Detroit with a 1-0 record.

KC Joyner’s takeaways
Here are a few items of note from this contest:

David Montgomery has shown he may end up being the lead running back in the Lions offense this season, ending this game with 21 carries for 74 yards and a touchdown. If he does so, it may have a negative impact on fantasy teams that drafted Jahmyr Gibbs, but it could also mean that Gibbs is going to have a Christian McCaffrey-type role in this offense that develops as the season progresses.
It was surprising that Kansas City didn’t try to rely on the run more often in this contest, but that may be due in part to the Kelce injury occurring so late in the week that a total revamp of the gameplan wasn’t possible.
Kadarius Toney is rostered in 56 percent of ESPN leagues, but that number could drop by a significant margin after he had an abysmal game tonight.
Sam LaPorta caught all five of the targets sent in his direction. This comes after a strong preseason and could portend for LaPorta being a high percentage, high volume pass catcher for the Lions offense.

The Chiefs drop their season opener for the first time since 2014, snapping their eight-game win streak in Week 1 games.

The longest active win streak in season openers is now four games, shared by the Seahawks, Saints and Chargers.

With tonight's win, the Lions snap their three-game losing streak in Week 1 games. Detroit actually tied the Cardinals in its 2019 opener so this marks its first 1-0 start since 2017.

Kadarius Toney unable to find the handle
Chiefs wide receiver Kadarius Toney could be credited with as many as four drops on his five targets tonight including the first play of Kansas City's final drive.

Toney entered the night ranked 94th in drop rate (6.9 percent) among 107 wide receivers with at least 75 targets since he entered the league in 2021.

Two-minute warning in favor of the Lions
Detroit not only got the stop on 4th-and-20, they also got the advantage of having the two-minute warning occur before their offense took over. That wouldn’t have been the case even one second earlier and it may be the edge needed to win this game.

Lions need help in running a clock-burning offense
The Lions made some mistakes in running a clock-burning offense on that drive, as Jared Goff was snapping the ball with 10 seconds on the clock and called for plays that could go out of bounds.

This is generally a well-coached team, but these types of errors are part of why this club lost some games last year that they could have won, and may help result in a loss tonight.

David Montgomery outpaces Jahymr Gibbs
Fantasy managers weren’t sure how to value David Montgomery in relation to Jahmyr Gibbs in recent drafts, as there was an expectation Gibbs would end up as the lead back in this offense. But that hasn’t been the case so far tonight.

Montgomery has posted 15 carries for 56 yards and a touchdown (11.6 PPR points) versus Gibbs getting six carries for 24 yards and two catches for 18 yards (9.1 PPR points). If that trend continues throughout the year, Montgomery could see a carry volume that makes him a RB2 candidate this season.

Which Lions will end the game?
The Lions had trouble finishing games early in 2022. It was their entire identity in the second half of the season.

With Detroit up 21-20 with 5:07 to go, which Lions team will we get in the 2023 opener? Stay tuned.

Lions still finishing drives
Some wondered whether the Lions could continue to find success near the goal line with running back Jamaal Williams now with the Saints.

Williams, who led the NFL in goal-to-go rushes (28) and touchdowns (15) in 2022, helped Detroit score touchdowns on 85.4 percent of its goal-to-go drives in 2022 (second in NFL).

So far tonight, two goal-to-go drives, two touchdowns, including David Montgomery’s go-ahead score from 8 yards out in the fourth quarter.

The Detroit Lions can bask in the afterglow of one of their biggest wins in years before getting back to work.

Detroit beat the Kansas City Chiefs 21-20 Thursday night and don’t play again until hosting Seattle on Sept. 17.

“It’s crucial,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said Friday. “I think it’s big to rest the body for about three days before we get ready for Seattle.

“I think it’s huge and I think it worked out perfect for us.”

Chiefs’ Chris Jones: ‘I would change it’ if given another chance to avoid a holdout
The Lions matched, or perhaps exceeded, the hype about their ascending franchise with a road win over the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs.

“Not the same old Lions, the 1-0 Lions,” NBC’s Mike Tirico said during the broadcast.

Tirico went on to mention Kansas City’s win over the defending champion New England Patriots several years ago on the road in an opener that announced the Chiefs would be a factor.

“This has an asterisk because of no Chris Jones and no Travis Kelce, but after what you saw at the end of last year and what you saw tonight, the blue and silver is for real,” Tirico said.

Campbell was asked a day later about what Tirico said with a question that didn’t include the rest of the broadcaster’s sentence.

“Well, is there an asterisk by the 1-0?” Campbell asked.

Tirico, who lives in Michigan, was inundated with interview requests on Friday,

“If you listen to the entirety of what I said, it’s much more in context with just lifting half the quote,” he said. “I understand the disappointment with the word asterisk, and that’s OK.”

WHAT’S WORKING
ADVERTISEMENT


General manager Brad Holmes, in his third year, looks like he hit more than he missed in this year’s NFL draft.

Brian Branch, the No. 45 selection overall, picked off Patrick Mahomes and returned the interception 50 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter to help the Lions pull into a 14-14 tie.

First-round pick Jahmyr Gibbs and second-round selection Sam LaPorta combined for 99 yards of offense. Gibbs, a dynamic running back, had 42 yards on seven carries. LaPorta caught two passes for 18 yards and was a key blocker on some plays. Linebacker Jack Campbell, drafted No. 18 overall, had two tackles.

“They settled in and the stage wasn’t too much for them,” Campbell said.

WHAT NEEDS HELP
ADVERTISEMENT


Campbell said at the top of the team’s to-do list is improving the offense’s tempo.

“We can be so much better,” he said.

STOCK UP
Campbell. The gutsy coach called for a fake punt in the first quarter and converted for the seventh time in eight fake punts in his three seasons. Campbell has seemed to make all the right moves on and off the field, leading the Lions to nine wins in 11 games dating to last season.

STOCK DOWN

Marvin Jones was targeted six times and had two receptions for 8 yards and lost a fumble deep in Kansas City territory late in the first half. It was the wide receiver’s first fumble in his 12-year career.

INJURIES
Offensive tackle Taylor Decker had an ankle injury early in the game, but the ailment didn’t prevent him from playing.

KEY NUMBER
359 — The number of passes Goff has thrown without an interception, trailing streaks by Aaron Rodgers (402) and Tom Brady (399) in NFL history.

Rodgers-less Packers beat Bears, 38-20
The Green Bay Packers have a long history of excellent quarterbacks. The period of leadership under Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers saw the team excel during the regular season – although the team arguably underperformed in the playoffs.

So following Rodgers’ departure to the New York Jets in the spring, a new era has been ushered in in Wisconsin under Jordan Love.

And it began in perfect fashion, continuing the Packers’ stranglehold over the Chicago Bears with a 38-20 victory at Soldier Field in Chicago which saw Love excel in his first start having been named the team’s official No. 1 QB.

‘Enjoy the little things’: Aaron Rodgers imparts wisdom during New York Jets training camp
The fourth-year quarterback threw for 245 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions in an almost perfect performance as the Packers used a big second half to pull away.

Running back Aaron Jones had two touchdowns – one on the ground and one through the air – as the Packers recorded their ninth straight victory over their NFC North division rivals and fifth straight at Soldier Field.

With all eyes on Love after spending three seasons as Rodgers’ back-up and the weight of the Packers’ excellent record against the Bears weighing on his shoulders – Rodgers went viral two seasons ago for shouting “I still own you” after scoring against the Bears – the 24-year-old said he was just appreciative of an opening-week victory.

“We knew what type of game we were in for,” Love said. “Obviously, my first game in this rivalry, so I mean it felt good.

“They’re a good team. Obviously, first half was close and, second half, the way we just bounced back and came out there in the second half and just total domination. It felt good. It just feels good to get a win, never take that for granted.”

The Green Bay Packers dominated the Chicago Bears in the trenches on both sides of the ball, a recurrent theme of the last decade. 

Both young quarterbacks made plays and missed opportunities, but Green Bay had Chicago fans booing early in the second half in what was a complete blowout.

Offensive spotlight: Packers running back Aaron Jones was untouchable through the air and on the ground before leaving early with a hamstring injury. Jones took nine carries for 41 yards and a touchdown and tacked on two receptions for 86 yards and another score. The receiving touchdown came on a fourth-and-3 where Jones left Bears linebacker T.J. Edwards in his wake right off the line. 

Justin Fields finished 24-of-37 for 216 yards, with one touchdown and one ugly interception. He added nine rushes for 59 yards, almost all on scrambles. Fields evaded pressure all day long and made several defenders whiff on would-be sacks, making something out of nothing throughout the afternoon. 

Defensive spotlight: Packers 2022 first-round pick linebacker Quay Walker looked like a natural ball carrier as he broke a few tackles on a pick-six to pretty much ice this football game. Unfortunately, Walker left the game with a potential concussion suffered on a hit from Bears rookie tackle Darnell Wright right at the pylon. 

Chicago Bears free-agent acquisition Yannick Ngakoue showed exactly why he was able to secure a one-year, $10.5 million deal in August, as he produced a sack and two tackles for loss in the first half. His name wasn’t called much after that, as Green Bay dominated both lines of scrimmage for most of the game. 

Rookie spotlight: Green Bay Packers rookie wide receiver Jayden Reed caught two passes for 48 yards, and rookie tight end Luke Musgrave caught three passes for 50 yards, both showing serious speed in space. Reed also had a 35-yard punt return that gave Green Bay a short field for an eventual touchdown drive.

Bears rookie running back Roschon Johnson ran hard in the second half and also hauled in a few receptions, finishing with five carries for 20 yards and a touchdown to go along with five receptions for 30 yards. Johnson bowled over several defenders, and while he largely played in garbage time, he looks too good to keep off the field in first halves for much longer.

ptimism surrounded the Chicago Bears entering Sunday’s clash against the Green Bay Packers, especially with the buzz around third-year quarterback Justin Fields.

However, they faced a sobering realization after a heavy investment this offseason. Their struggles against Green Bay continued, with the losing streak against this iconic rival extending to nine games, underlined by Sunday’s 38-20 loss at Soldier Field.

We recap it here:

Offense: Off to Rocky Start

Quinn Harris/Getty Images

Right from the opening whistle, Chicago’s offense appeared disjointed. Fields completed 24-of-37 passes for 216 yards. He found the end zone once and threw a costly pick-six. With high expectations this season, Fields’ performance left many questions unanswered.

Receiver DJ Moore, the anticipated offseason catch, had an unusually silent game with only two receptions for 25 yards. In contrast, Fields consistently eyed receiver Darnell Mooney, who ended with a team-high 53 receiving yards and a touchdown.

However, not all woes can be attributed to Fields. The revamped offensive line, touted as an offseason strength, wilted under Green Bay’s relentless pass rush, giving up four sacks. Matt Eberflus undoubtedly has this vulnerability on his radar.

On the brighter side, rookie running back Roschon Johnson offered a ray of hope. With 55 all-purpose yards and a touchdown, he’s shaping up to be a potential future RB1.


Defense: Packers Run Rampant

Michael Reaves/Getty Images

The Bears’ offense faltered, but it was the defense that indeed caught the eye – for the wrong reasons. Coming off a season where they held one of the league’s most porous defenses, they seemed unprepared for Green Bay.

Quarterback Jordan Love, stepping in for the departed Aaron Rodgers, had a field day. Completing 15-of-27 passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns, Love exuded confidence, particularly evident in a 61-yard touchdown drive, pushing Green Bay further ahead after the Bears had clawed back to a 10-point deficit.

Running back Aaron Jones continued his dominance over Chicago, recording 127 scrimmage yards, including a 35-yard touchdown reception. He suffered a hamstring injury on that scoring play and didn’t return.


Looking Ahead: Facing the Buccaneers

Quinn Harris/Getty Images

Losing in Week 1 is hard; losing to a long-time rival is even more challenging. The Bears must tighten their defense and hone their offense to rebound against the Buccaneers.

The journey ahead is lengthy; a single game shouldn’t set the tone. But with an 11-game skid hanging over them, the Bears are eager to rediscover the winning formula. The potential is there, and a passionate fan base backs them. It’s high time they regroup and turn the tide.


Injuries

Michael Reaves/Getty Images

Second-year cornerback Kyler Gordon left the game in the second half with a hand injury. He did not return.

Two of the top-10 picks from this year's NFL Draft are set to square off in Week 1 as Bryce Young's Carolina Panthers play Bijan Robinson's Atlanta Falcons.

The Panthers traded up from the No. 9 pick, one spot behind the Falcons, to acquire Young, who they hope will be their next franchise quarterback.

Meanwhile, despite other positions of need on the board, the Falcons opted to select running back Bijan Robinson, making him the highest-selected running back in the draft since Saquon Barkley back in 2018.


The two played against each other last year in college, where Young's Alabama Crimson Tide edged out Bijan's Texas Longhorns. Last night, Texas got revenge on Alabama with a win in Tuscaloosa, and Falcons fans hope Bijan can get revenge on Young and the Panthers.

If the Falcons win today, it will be their first Week 1 victory since 2017, as well as their first time over .500 since that time. It would give Atlanta a lot of momentum in a season where the NFC South title could be within reach.

FINAL: Falcons Win 24-10 Against the Panthers to take the lead in the NFC South



Bijan Robinson makes his debut: The Falcons used a strong two-man committee that drove them to victory.

Atlanta used a pretty even split between the two running backs, with a slight tendency to use Allgeier in running situations and Robinson in passing situations.
Robinson maintained a massive 33.3% target rate, which hurt the fantasy production of all of the other Falcons receivers.
Both running backs maintained 5.0 yards per carry or better, with Robinson being slightly more explosive.
Robinson maintained a clear edge in offensive snaps over the first three quarters. He played in 26-of-33 snaps over the three quarters while Allgeier was used more as a closer, playing in 11-of-15 snaps in the fourth quarter.
Robinson’s touchdown occurred in the second quarter, where both of Allgeier’s happened in the fourth quarter.
While Allgeier will score more touchdowns this season, I would not anticipate Allgeier consistently being the goal-line back for Atlanta.
Robinson will remain a must-start going forward, but there is a chance Allgeier can also be a fantasy starter.


Kyle Pitts’ quiet game: The Falcons' tight end led the team in receiving yards, but that won’t be enough to satisfy fantasy managers.

He caught two of his three targets for 44 yards, with all of his targets coming in the second half of the game.
Pitts was rotated in and out of the game similar to his worst games last season.
If there was any personnel group you would expect Pitts to be on the field, it would be 11 personnel, but he only took three snaps from 11 personnel out of a possible nine.
If Pitts was used similarly to how he was last season before his injury, he could be a consistent fantasy starter even in Atlanta’s run-first offense.
If Atlanta plays every game like this, then Pitts still probably needs to be a fantasy starter, but there will be many frustrating weeks.


The Panthers two-back committee: There was talk all offseason about Miles Sanders taking a three-down role, but that wasn’t the case in this game.

Sanders missed most of training camp and all of the preseason due to a groin injury.
Sanders was the clear starter on early downs with Chuba Hubbard also seeing significant playing time on first and second downs.
Hubbard was consistently the Panther on the field on third downs outside of a third-and-1.
Hubbard was the more impressive runner throughout the game, averaging 6.7 yards per carry while Sanders at one point lost a fumble.
Sanders did see more targets and receptions despite not having the passing down role.
The one promising point for Sanders is he did see significant work during two-minute drills, which is a sign Carolina trusts him as a receiver.
The biggest concerning point is Hubbard played significantly in short-yardage situations, which could lead to Hubbard stealing some touchdowns down the line.
It’s possible Sanders starts to see more playing time once he’s further removed from his injury, but for the time being, Sanders goes from a must-start to someone worth starting as long as the matchup is anywhere from good to average.


Hayden Hurst is a tight end to watch: Hurst led the team in receiving yards and scored their only touchdown, but he didn’t see as much playing time as we originally thought. 

Hurst caught five of his seven targets for 41 yards and a touchdown.
He was consistently seeing the clear majority of snaps with the starters throughout the preseason.
Carolina stuck with 11 or 01 personnel for the majority of the with only five snaps in two tight end sets, so the majority of the snaps by the other tight ends were in place of Hurst.
While part of the explanation for his low snaps could simply be Carolina ran a lot of plays and a lot of pass plays in particular, he also only played in seven of 14 snaps in the first quarter, so this was also partially by design.
He is a fine waiver wire target for a fantasy manager looking for a backup, but we will need to see more games before we can trust Hurst in a fantasy starting lineup.
Miscellaneous Notes

Drake London only left the game for five snaps but was only targeted once on his 22 pass routes, which is discouraging.
KhaDarel Hodge is expected to be the Falcons' third wide receiver long-term, but Hodge was questionable coming into this game with an ankle injury, which is likely why Scott Miller received more offensive snaps than Hodge.
Terrace Marshall Jr. became a starter with D.J. Chark Jr. missing this game with a hamstring injury. It’s possible we see a little bit more of a rotation once he’s healthy if they want to keep Marshall involved.
Table Notes
• Snaps include plays called back due to penalties, including offensive holding or defensive pass interference. The other three stats have these plays removed.

• Targets may differ from official NFL sources. The most likely discrepancy would be from a clear thrown-away pass, where the NFL may give the target to the nearest receiver, while this data will not.

• Carries are only on designed plays. Quarterback scrambles won’t count for the total number of carries in the game.

Following each Panthers’ game this season we’re going to reset the chains and line it up on first and ten. 

This will include ten things that I think are either interesting, cool, notable, important, or anything else that comes to my mind that is Panthers-related. It may also include things that other people care about, and are making a big deal about, that I want to pour some cold water on and wake up the sheeple. Takes are flying like UFOs (pencil me in as not a believer, unrelated) - let’s talk about them.


1. Bryce Young takes accountability for his mistakes

I am twenty-eight years old and on the precipice of twenty-nine. I have learned a ton about being accountable for my actions and how they affect other people because I am a grown man with a house, a wife, and a kid on the way.

Bryce Young is twenty-two, baby-faced, and carrying the hopes and dreams of a city and franchise on his shoulders. When I was twenty-two I was staying up way too late playing Fortnite with my buddies and showing up late to meetings on the regular. We are not the same.


If you haven’t yet, watch Young’s postgame press conference. The maturity the rookie quarterback shows is frankly unbelievable. He credits the defense for their stifling performance while admitting that the loss is on his shoulders. That is objectively not the case as football is a team game and on any play, eleven players need to do their job to be successful, but kudos to Young for holding himself accountable.


His play on the field is one thing (which I detailed here), but Bryce Young the man is everything advertised and more off the field. Head coach Frank Reich praised his maturity in his postgame press conference, and it was on full display following the loss. I’d follow Bryce Young to the ends of the earth on any day that ends with a Y.

2. Brian Burns makes a statement



The Pro Bowl EDGE and the front office are still in a stalemate, but Burns laid his cards on the table in Atlanta. Jessie Bates was the most impactful defensive player on the field yesterday, but Burns was right behind him. Thankfully, Burns has committed to playing all season even without having a new contract signed.

3. Jaycee Horn keeps letting the Panthers down

It’s a real bummer at this point. When Horn is playing football, he is an elite corner. Full stop. Unfortunately, he doesn’t play football enough.




Horn has only played in 18 of the Panthers’ 35 games since being drafted, and he left this one early with a hamstring injury. His status going forward is up in the air, but soft tissue injuries linger and it wouldn’t be a surprise if this hampered Horn for the rest of the season. Scott Fitterer and the front office failed to address the cornerback room until signing Troy Hill in late August, and it may come back to bite them.


4. Hayden Hurst chucks Bryce Young’s first touchdown to the moon


10/10. No notes.

6. The wide receiver room lacks juice

It was a narrative all offseason, but the lack of speed on the Carolina offense reared its ugly head on Sunday.

Yes, DJ Chark was unavailable, but the rest of the receivers failed to make an impact down the field. Bryce Young was 0-7 on throws further than 13 yards downfield. Part of that is on Young for missing Jonathan Mingo and Terrace Marshall Jr. on deep balls when the young pass catchers had separation, but Young also had limited opportunities to throw it downfield.



According to Next Gen Stats, the only receiver or tight end who separated at an above-average clip was Laviska Shenault who spent most of his afternoon running routes behind the line of scrimmage. It is to be seen if Chark will make an impact upon his return, but long term, getting Bryce Young an elite weapon has to be a priority for the front office.


We’ve seen copious examples of teams drafting a quarterback and then delivering them an elite pass catcher two or three years into their career. Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs. Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown. Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase. Trevor Lawrence and Calvin Ridley (this one is early but returns look good after week one).

There will be options on the open market in 2024 and one of those options should be on a flight to Charlotte the second free agency opens.


7. The offensive line made an impact

The story of the preseason in Carolina was how much the offensive line had regressed. That story was totally fair. The starting five linemen looked overmatched against both starters and backups, and folks were getting worried.

On Sunday, the offensive line was invisible, and that’s a good thing. PFF graded out every starter from average to above average. 



Young was only sacked two times and both of those were in pure passing situations down two scores with less than five minutes remaining. Young had time to throw from clean pockets as the line stifled a stout Falcons front seven.


On top of that, the Panthers ran for 154 yards at a 4.8-yard per-carry clip. Pretty solid day at the office for a much-maligned unit.

8. Bijan Robinson is a problem



How can you hate Bijan Robinson? He’s an awesome football player and Panthers' fans will dread playing him twice a year for however long he’s in Atlanta.

9. As a whole, the defense was stout

The Falcons only managed 221 yards from scrimmage. If Carolina hadn’t gifted the Falcons three short fields with turnovers, this game would have been completely different. I don’t like playing the ifs and buts game, but it’s applicable here.


NFL prognosticators pegged Atlanta as a potential top-ten offense in the league this year and the combination of a hungry Panthers’ defense and Desmond Ridder’s incompetence turned the Falcons into Georgia Tech for most of the game. An L is an L, but there are absolutely positive takeaways from the defensive side of the ball.

10. That whole penalties on
