Q1:
The game commenced with an unexpected move from the Las Vegas Raiders, as they executed an onside kick. However, this turned to their favor when a penalty was called against Denver’s T.Smith for an illegal touch. Capitalizing on the opportunity, the Raiders marched down the field. J.Jacobs played a role with a few runs, but it was J.Garoppolo’s pass to D.Adams that turned out to be significant, covering 13 yards and moving the chains on a crucial 4th down. Although they faced resistance, an Unnecessary Roughness penalty on Denver's J.Simmons aided the Raiders' efforts. The drive concluded with the Raiders punching in the first touchdown of the game. The Broncos responded in kind, commencing their drive with a solid return from M.Mims that was, unfortunately, tainted by a holding penalty. Despite this setback, R.Wilson demonstrated his passing prowess, connecting with B.Johnson for 21 yards and A.Trautman for another 15 yards, positioning the Broncos within striking distance. J.Williams provided balance to the offense with some noteworthy runs. This collective effort culminated in a Broncos touchdown, wrapping up the quarter with a score of 6-7 in favor of the Raiders.

Q2:
The Raiders kicked off the second quarter with an impressive drive. J.Garoppolo exhibited excellent chemistry with J.Meyers, connecting on a couple of impactful passes totaling 34 yards, pushing them deep into Broncos territory. However, the Broncos defense tightened their grip, holding the Raiders to a field goal. The ensuing Broncos drive began promisingly, especially when a Neutral Zone Infraction penalty on the Raiders provided a fresh set of downs. However, the Raiders' defense, led by standout plays from M.Crosby and D.Deablo, stifled the Broncos' momentum. This included a sack on R.Wilson and a play where J.McLaughlin lost 7 yards. The drive regressed, forcing the Broncos to punt. The Raiders' subsequent possession started deep in their own territory. J.Jacobs and D.Adams made minor contributions, but a Neutral Zone Infraction on Denver's F.Clark gifted the Raiders an automatic first down. Despite this, the drive details provided end here, indicating the Raiders had to punt at some point later in this drive. The half concluded with the Raiders leading the Broncos 10-6.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Denver Broncos initiating a decent drive down the field. Starting at their 26-yard line, courtesy of a 30-yard return by M. Mims, the Broncos made notable progress mainly on the ground with contributions from J. Williams and S. Perine. However, R. Wilson's pass game was inconsistent during the drive. The momentum was almost disrupted by R. Wilson's fumble, but a penalty on the Raiders turned the play into a no-game. After steadily making their way to the Raiders' 37, the Broncos attempted a 55-yard field goal which unfortunately went wide right, wasting their almost 5 and a half-minute drive.

The Raiders responded with a methodical offensive attack led by quarterback J. Garoppolo. While they primarily looked to J. Jacobs for their running game, Garoppolo sought to connect with D. Adams multiple times. The Raiders’ drive, which started at their 45, experienced some setbacks due to penalties but benefitted from a major defensive pass interference call on the Broncos. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't capitalize on the advantage, and their drive ended with an interception.

Q4:
In the fourth quarter, the Broncos began their drive near the end of the third quarter. Using a balanced attack of runs and short passes, they steadily advanced downfield. The highlight of the drive was R. Wilson's 20-yard pass to S. Perine. A roughing the kicker penalty on the Raiders during a punt attempt extended the Broncos' drive. Despite making it to the Raiders' 5-yard line, they were unable to punch it into the end zone. The Broncos settled for a field goal, taking the score to 16-10 in their favor.

The Raiders wasted no time on their subsequent drive. They covered 75 yards in just six plays, a drive heavily aided by penalties against the Broncos. Garoppolo made key completions, especially a significant 18-yarder to D. Adams. The drive was summarized in the provided details up until a timeout was called at 6:34 with the Raiders at the Broncos' 6-yard line. Based on the result mentioned, the Raiders managed to secure a touchdown, taking the lead 17-16.

The Broncos, hoping to regain the lead, had a rather underwhelming response. J. Williams lost a yard on the first play, and even though R. Wilson completed an 8-yard pass on third down, they found themselves punting after only three plays. The quarter's details end with the Broncos punting the ball to the Raiders, who presumably are looking to either extend their lead or run down the clock.
