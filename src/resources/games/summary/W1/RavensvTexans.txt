Q1:

The game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Houston Texans commenced with the Ravens receiving the kick-off. The first drive by the Ravens was unproductive, which saw L. Jackson get sacked by J. Greenard and end up punting the ball. The Texans then took over but struggled to progress as well, with C. Stroud being sacked by P. Queen. However, a critical penalty on the Ravens gave the Texans another shot, which they squandered, leading to a punt.

The Ravens' third drive displayed some promise, with L. Jackson making considerable gains and Z. Flowers also playing a crucial role. However, the promising drive ended in disappointment when L. Jackson's pass intended for Z. Flowers was intercepted by S. Nelson. Houston's next possession was similarly unproductive as they faced penalties and could only gain a minimal yardage before punting.

The Ravens then took over and masterfully executed a scoring drive, highlighted by a deep pass from L. Jackson to Z. Flowers that got them close to the end zone. This drive concluded with a touchdown, putting the Ravens ahead 7-0. However, the Texans were unable to respond effectively on their subsequent possession, marking the end of the first quarter.

Q2:

The second quarter saw the Ravens starting off with the ball. While they made some gains, a penalty against S. Nelson for Defensive Pass Interference was the most significant event in the early part of the drive. However, a series of further penalties against the Ravens, including an Illegal Use of Hands by R. Stanley and Intentional Grounding by L. Jackson, stunted their progress. The drive ended with them punting the ball.

The Texans then showcased a long and well-orchestrated drive, managing to progress considerably down the field over 15 plays. Although details for the entire drive aren't provided, it culminated in a field goal, allowing the Texans to put some points on the board, making the score 7-3 in favor of the Ravens.

To conclude, the first half saw a dominant performance from the Ravens, but the Texans displayed resilience towards the end of Q2, hinting at a potentially competitive second half.

Q3:

The third quarter started with the Houston Texans at a disadvantage with a score of 7-6 in favor of the Baltimore Ravens. The Texans began the half poorly, failing to make any substantial progress and punting after three unsuccessful plays. In contrast, the Ravens displayed dominance, quickly capitalizing on their possession with a 71-yard drive that ended in a touchdown, increasing their lead to 15-6. The Ravens' key player, L. Jackson, played a significant role in this success with a deep pass to Z. Flowers and another short pass to R. Bateman that significantly advanced their position.

Houston's following drive seemed promising, initially gaining 17 yards. However, despite their efforts and moving towards the Ravens' territory, the Texans were halted on the fourth down, unable to convert the needed yard for a first down. Baltimore quickly retaliated, and although they faced a few setbacks, they managed to score another touchdown, pushing their lead further to 22-6. Houston's defensive challenges continued as they could not stop the Ravens' drive, which was highlighted by a significant 13-yard gain by G. Edwards.

A twist came towards the end of the third quarter when L. Jackson, during the Ravens' drive, fumbled the ball due to a sack, allowing the Texans to recover it in a good field position. The Texans took advantage of this opportunity, making steady progress, and as the quarter came to a close, they were nearing the Ravens' end zone. The quarter concluded with the Texans in a promising position but still trailing 22-6.

Q4:
The fourth quarter began with an incomplete pass by C.Stroud intended for D.Schultz, followed by a timeout at 13:47. The Baltimore Ravens took possession in their Drive18, navigating through 6 plays that lasted 3:33 and covered 12 yards before having to punt. L.Jackson showcased his passing skills with a notable 17-yard pass to Z.Flowers but was subsequently sacked twice.

The Houston Texans' Drive19 began with promise, especially with a 26-yard pass completion to N.Collins. However, it was cut short when C.Stroud was sacked and fumbled the ball, leading to a recovery by the Ravens.

Drive20 for the Ravens was more fruitful. After a series of plays, L.Jackson connected with O.Beckham for a significant 29-yard gain. The drive culminated in a field goal, increasing the Ravens' lead to 25-9.

The Texans attempted to rally in Drive21, with C.Stroud showcasing his versatility by both passing and scrambling. However, the drive concluded with an incomplete pass on a crucial 4th and 13. The Ravens, in their subsequent possession (Drive22), played it safe, running the ball thrice before punting it away.

In the last minute, the Texans tried to salvage some points with their final drive of the game (Drive23). C.Stroud made a series of short passes, moving the ball progressively up the field. However, as the clock ticked down, they couldn't capitalize on their final plays, and the game concluded with the Ravens leading 25-9.
