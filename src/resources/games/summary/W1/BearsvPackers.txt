Q1:
The Bears started the quarter with possession but stalled due to a combination of the Packers' stifling defense, led by P.Smith, and a costly penalty. After an initial decent runback, their drive lasted for six plays covering only 28 yards before giving up the ball on downs. The Packers then capitalized on their ensuing drive, covering 40 yards over 11 plays and ultimately reaching the end zone. While the Bears initially held them back with defensive plays by D.Walker and T.Stevenson, the Packers persisted, primarily relying on A.Jones and a few timely passes by J.Love. The Bears returned with a purposeful drive, moving 38 yards over 7 plays, with J.Fields making vital pass completions. Unfortunately, the drive ended with a field goal, bringing the score to CHI 3, GB 7. The Packers then went three-and-out, managing only 4 yards in their drive. The Bears got the ball back with T.Scott making a noteworthy return, but they too would be held to a field goal, rounding out the quarter at CHI 6, GB 7.

Q2:
The second quarter commenced with the Bears in possession and trying to advance from where they left off in Q1. J.Fields, displaying his dexterity, managed to cover ground both through the air and on foot. D.Foreman's efforts on the ground further propelled the Bears closer to scoring territory. Fields connected twice with D.Moore, including a 14-yard completion that got the Bears within striking distance of the end zone. However, the drive's momentum was hampered by a missed pass targeting C.Kmet and concluded with yet another field goal. The Packers then had a short, 3-play drive that failed to gain much ground. After a massive punt from D.Whelan, the Bears regained possession. Unfortunately for Chicago, they found themselves pinned back due to a penalty on B.Jones, and the drive stalled, requiring them to punt the ball away. The half ended with a narrow margin as the Packers led the Bears 7-6.

Q3:
The second half opened with the Green Bay Packers in possession, starting from their 25-yard line. They executed a meticulous 8-play drive that spanned 75 yards and culminated in a touchdown, taking the lead to 17-6. This drive was highlighted by a 51-yard pass from J.Love to A.Jones, setting the Packers up deep in the Bears' territory. On the Bears' ensuing possession, they had a woeful outing. Starting at their 25-yard line, J.Fields was immediately sacked for a loss of 11 yards. This set the tone for a disappointing series that ended with a punt after only three plays. The Packers capitalized on their good field position after the punt, starting on the Bears' 42-yard line. Despite a setback of a 2-yard loss on their first play, the Packers' offense continued to be productive. They scored another touchdown on a 35-yard pass play, although A.Jones was injured in the process. The Bears got the ball back and moved it with some efficiency, but their drive was prematurely ended by a fumble by J.Fields which was recovered by the Packers. However, the Packers couldn't capitalize on the turnover, ending their possession with a punt. The Bears, not to be outdone, put together a swift 6-play, 65-yard touchdown drive. The Bears executed a successful two-point conversion, ending the third quarter with a score of 24-14 in favor of the Packers.

Q4:
The fourth quarter began with the Packers in possession. Their offensive prowess remained evident as they combined both the ground and air game. This drive, starting from their own 39-yard line, culminated in a touchdown after a string of efficient plays, including an impressive 37-yard pass to L.Musgrave. This extended the Packers' lead to 31-14. The Bears looked to respond, starting from their own 25-yard line. However, misfortune struck as J.Fields threw an interception to Q.Walker, who returned it 37 yards for another Packers touchdown. A subsequent unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Packers seemed to have little impact on their momentum. The score now stood at a dominant 38-14 in favor of Green Bay. As the quarter continued, the Bears had another chance to respond. They began their drive from their 30-yard line, but after a series of plays, they were forced to punt once more. The provided information ends here, but it is evident that the Packers have dominated the Bears in both offense and defense in the second half.
