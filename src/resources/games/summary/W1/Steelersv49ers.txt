Q1:

The first quarter began with the Pittsburgh Steelers gaining possession, but their first drive was uneventful, ending in a punt after K. Pickett was sacked, forcing a loss of 10 yards. San Francisco 49ers capitalized on their good starting field position on their first drive, pushing down the field with a mix of runs and passes. Highlighted by B. Purdy's 11-yard pass to G. Kittle on a 4th down conversion, the drive culminated in a touchdown, establishing an early 7-0 lead for the 49ers.

The Steelers’ next possession was short-lived; after gaining only 5 yards, K. Pickett threw an interception to C. Ward, giving the 49ers another opportunity. San Francisco made an initial push but found themselves stalling near the red zone. J. Moody attempted a 46-yard field goal that was blocked, but a penalty on P. Peterson allowed them to reattempt from a closer distance. Moody converted the 41-yard field goal, widening the gap to 10-0. The quarter concluded with the Steelers punting the ball after a failed drive, and the 49ers starting their next offensive push.

Q2:

San Francisco started the second quarter on a high note. Despite a penalty setting them back, B. Purdy connected with D. Samuel for a 22-yard gain, setting the 49ers up in the red zone. A few plays later, Purdy found B. Aiyuk in the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown pass, taking the score to 17-0 in favor of the 49ers.

Pittsburgh's offensive struggles continued into the second quarter. Their next possession began with a loss of 5 yards on a pass to J. Warren, compounded by an offensive holding penalty (which was declined). The drive ended in yet another punt after K. Pickett was sacked. The quarter summary is cut off, but the narrative so far shows the Steelers’ offensive struggles and the 49ers' ability to capitalize on their opportunities.

Q3:

The third quarter witnessed an offensive surge from the San Francisco 49ers and a struggle for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 49ers initiated with a quick 75-yard drive, taking just two plays and less than a minute. It began with a short pass from B.Purdy to D.Samuel, followed by a standout 65-yard rush from Christian McCaffrey for a touchdown, elevating the score to 27-7 in favor of the 49ers. The Steelers, in their subsequent drive, made a fair effort covering 30 yards in four plays, yet had to settle for a punt. This drive also saw an injury to D.Johnson, which might have impacted the Steelers' game plan. The 49ers' next possession was a mix of gains and losses, moving 23 yards in seven plays. B.Purdy and C.McCaffrey demonstrated some good connections, but T.Watt's impact was undeniable, as he managed to sack Purdy, forcing a punt for the 49ers. Unfortunately for the 49ers, their next possession saw a costly mistake; a sack by T.Watt on B.Purdy led to a fumble recovered by the Steelers. The quarter wrapped up with the Steelers marching 31 yards down the field, getting as close as the 49ers' 8-yard line, but they couldn’t capitalize, turning the ball over on downs.

Q4:

The fourth quarter started with the 49ers in possession, managing a commendable 47-yard drive before punting the ball. A notable moment in the drive was a 22-yard connection from B.Purdy to B.Aiyuk, though an injury to T.Williams became a concern for the 49ers. When the Steelers got the ball back, they looked promising, moving the ball 48 yards in seven plays. With quick passes from K.Pickett connecting with various receivers, they seemed to be finding some rhythm. However, the drive ended in despair for the Steelers, as an interception terminated their progression.

Throughout both quarters, the 49ers showcased their offensive prowess and defensive pressure. The Steelers, although demonstrating flashes of potential, struggled to maintain consistent momentum and capitalize on opportunities.
