Q1:
The first quarter began with the Seattle Seahawks in possession, mounting a 12-play, 57-yard drive that took up over 5 minutes. They capitalized on a defensive pass interference penalty against the Rams which set them up in the red zone, but stalled at the 18-yard line. J.Myers successfully converted a 36-yard field goal, putting Seattle ahead 3-0. The Rams responded with a sustained 16-play, 75-yard drive that saw quarterback M.Stafford efficiently moving the chains. The key play was a pass to T.Higbee that got them deep into Seattle territory. The drive culminated in a touchdown, putting the Rams in the lead, 7-3, at the end of the first quarter.

Q2:
The second quarter saw the Seahawks re-establishing dominance. Starting at the tail-end of Q1 and transitioning into Q2, Seattle conducted a 12-play, 75-yard drive. Quarterback G.Smith showcased his accuracy, targeting T.Lockett, D.Metcalf, and J.Smith-Njigba for pivotal first downs. The drive ended with a touchdown pass to D.Metcalf, giving Seattle a 10-7 advantage.

The Rams, on their next possession, faced disaster. A series of penalties, including a Face Mask and Delay of Game, pushed them back deep into their own territory. They were unable to recover and were forced to punt after only three plays. Seattle took advantage of the good field position on the ensuing drive, advancing 28 yards in just 6 plays. They concluded the drive with another successful J.Myers field goal, extending their lead to 13-7.

Overall, the Seahawks showcased consistency in their drives, effectively mixing the pass and run, while the Rams, despite their early touchdown, struggled with penalties that disrupted their offensive rhythm.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Los Angeles Rams launching a strong drive that culminated in a touchdown, swinging the score in their favor at 14-13. This 10-play, 76-yard drive lasted over 6 minutes, with notable contributions from Akers in the running game and a long pass from Stafford to Atwell for 44 yards. The Seahawks' response, however, was lackluster. Despite a penalty advantage on the kickoff, they were only able to muster a 3-play drive, gaining a mere 5 yards before having to punt. The Rams then showcased another impressive possession, amassing 60 yards over 9 plays. They faced some resistance from the Seahawks defense, resulting in them settling for a 38-yard field goal, furthering their lead to 17-13. The quarter ended with another weak drive from the Seahawks, who punted after 4 plays and a gain of only 10 yards. Crucially, the Seahawks' T.Lockett was injured during this drive. The Rams started another drive at the tail end of the third, which extended into the fourth quarter.

Q4:
The Rams continued their drive from the third quarter into the fourth, showing great ball control and game management. After a series of successful plays, including a crucial penalty against the Seahawks that placed the Rams just yards away from the endzone, the drive culminated in a touchdown, solidifying the Rams' control at 24-13. The Seahawks seemed to falter under the pressure, producing another unsuccessful drive, lasting only 3 plays and ending with a punt after gaining a paltry 2 yards. In contrast, the Rams maintained their momentum, stringing together a 9-play, 40-yard drive that, while stopped by the Seahawks' defense, still resulted in a field goal, pushing the Rams' lead to 27-13. The provided information ends during this Rams' drive.

Throughout the second half, the Rams showcased consistent offensive prowess and control, while the Seahawks struggled to mount any substantial response, reflected in their repeated short drives and reliance on punting.
