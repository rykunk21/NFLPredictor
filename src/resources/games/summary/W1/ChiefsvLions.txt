Q1:
The game between the Detroit Lions and the Kansas City Chiefs commenced with H. Butker's touchback kickoff for the Chiefs. The Detroit Lions initiated with their offense but failed to gain significant yardage, ending their first drive with a punt after only three plays and 7 yards gained. The Kansas City Chiefs then took possession, moving the ball 25 yards over 6 plays. This effort was highlighted by P. Mahomes' 10-yard pass to J. McKinnon and his subsequent scramble for another 2 yards. However, they too ended up punting.

The Lions showcased a more structured offensive strategy on their third drive. Starting from their 9-yard line, the Lions displayed a combination of runs and passes. The highlight of this drive was a fake punt where J. Reeves-Maybin secured a first down on a 4th & 2 situation. This strategic move seemed to fuel the Lions as they marched down the field with J. Goff's successful passes to A. St. Brown and J. Reynolds. D. Montgomery also contributed with some solid runs. Ultimately, the Lions capped off this 91-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass from J. Goff to A. St. Brown. Following a successful extra point, the Lions led 7-0.

The Chiefs responded with vigor. Their drive started with a touchback and progressed smoothly with a balanced mix of running and passing plays. P. Mahomes made some pivotal plays, including a deep 19-yard pass to Ju. Watson. The drive crossed over to the 2nd quarter and culminated in a touchdown, leveling the score at 7-7.

Q2:
The second quarter commenced with the Lions in possession. Kicking off from a touchback, the Lions orchestrated an impressive drive. J. Goff was instrumental, connecting with B. Wright, A. St. Brown, and S. LaPorta, pushing the team into Chiefs' territory. D. Montgomery consistently contributed short gains on the ground. However, disaster struck for the Lions when they reached the Chiefs' 17-yard line. On a muffed snap, they lost some yards, but J. Goff managed to recover the ball. Yet, on the next 3rd & 10 play, M. Jones fumbled after a short pass reception, and the Chiefs' B. Cook managed to recover the ball on the KC 7-yard line.

With the momentum seemingly shifting, the Chiefs started their next drive deep in their territory. They were limited in their progress, only gaining 5 yards in 3 plays. P. Mahomes tried to maneuver through the Lions' defense but found limited success, forcing the Chiefs to punt.


Q3:
The third quarter began with the Kansas City Chiefs (KC) in possession, but they were forced to punt after a short drive of only 14 yards in 5 plays. During this drive, the Chiefs' I.Pacheco was injured after a 10-yard completion from P.Mahomes. The Detroit Lions (DET) took over but had a brief drive of their own, advancing only 4 yards in 3 plays before punting the ball back to the Chiefs.

The Chiefs' next drive was catastrophic. On the third play, P.Mahomes threw an interception to B.Branch, who returned it for a 50-yard touchdown, tying the game at 14-14. After receiving the ball again, the Chiefs drove for 16 yards in 5 plays but had to punt. The Lions tried to capitalize on their momentum, embarking on a more effective drive than their previous ones, advancing 43 yards in 6 plays. Despite this progress, they were forced to punt from the Chiefs' 40-yard line.

The Chiefs then initiated a successful drive from their 10-yard line. They managed to travel 73 yards in 8 plays, with notable actions such as a 41-yard penalty on DET's C.Sutton for Defensive Pass Interference. However, unable to convert a 3rd down in the red zone, the Chiefs settled for a 35-yard field goal, taking the lead 17-14.

The Lions, in their final possession of the quarter, managed to gain 8 yards in 3 plays, but an unfortunate penalty on D.Montgomery for Tripping set them back, resulting in a punt as the quarter concluded.

Q4:
The fourth quarter started with the Chiefs in possession on their 32-yard line. They managed a promising drive, spearheaded by a 24-yard pass from P.Mahomes to N.Gray, taking them deep into Detroit territory. The Chiefs progressed steadily down the field, with notable plays such as a 7-yard pass to C.Edwards-Helaire and a 9-yard scramble by P.Mahomes. The drive summary provided only goes up to the Chiefs being on the Lions' 20-yard line with a 2nd & 1 situation, but it's mentioned that the drive resulted in a field goal, extending the Chiefs' lead to 20-14.
Following the Chiefs' field goal that pushed their lead to 20-14, the Detroit Lions started a drive on their own 25-yard line. Over 9 plays and 5 minutes, the Lions methodically advanced 75 yards. The drive saw some notable plays, including an 18-yard reception by J.Reynolds and another 33-yard pass to J.Reynolds that got the Lions within striking distance of the end zone. The scoring play was an 8-yard rush by D.Montgomery, and with the extra point by R.Patterson, the Lions took the lead 21-20.

The Chiefs' subsequent possession was short-lived, only achieving 6 yards in 3 plays, eventually punting the ball back to the Lions. An important play in this drive was a 3-yard loss on a direct snap to B.Bell.

The Lions then took control of the ball, making a brief push down the field. After gaining 21 yards in 5 plays, the Lions faced a 4th & 2 situation on the Chiefs' 45-yard line. A critical incompletion by J.Goff on 4th down turned over the ball to the Chiefs.

Kansas City had another opportunity to regain the lead, but their effort was stifled. Starting from their own 45-yard line, a promising 17-yard pass to S.Moore was nullified due to an offensive holding penalty. The Chiefs' situation deteriorated, facing a 4th & 25 situation from their own 30-yard line after a series of unsuccessful plays. P.Mahomes' deep pass intended for Ju.Watson was incomplete, effectively ending their scoring hopes.

The Lions, now in control and up by 1 point, started on the Chiefs' 30-yard line. With the Chiefs using all their timeouts, Detroit strategically used run plays and kneel-downs to run out the clock. J.Goff took three kneel-downs, and as the clock hit zero, the game concluded with the Detroit Lions narrowly defeating the Kansas City Chiefs, 21-20.
