Q1:
The game started with a kickoff by the Cardinals' M.Prater, giving the Washington Commanders the first possession. The Commanders managed to gain 26 yards over 8 plays but eventually had to punt after not being able to convert on third down. Notably, a penalty against the Commanders on the punt meant they lost some ground. The Cardinals' first possession was not any more fruitful. Starting from their own 17-yard line, they only managed 13 yards in 6 plays. A notable play from this drive was J.Dobbs' pass to Z.Ertz, which gained 6 yards and secured a first down. The Cardinals too had to punt. On the Commanders' second possession, the momentum shifted. Despite starting deep in their own territory, they managed a touchdown in a 91-yard, 6-play drive, bringing the score to 7-0. Crucial penalties against the Cardinals and a successful pass interference call against the Cardinals helped them considerably. The Cardinals, eager to respond, managed a field goal on their subsequent drive, which was spearheaded by a 29-yard run by M.Brown and a 31-yard pass to R.Moore. The quarter concluded with a 7-3 score favoring the Commanders.

Q2:
The second quarter started with the Commanders in possession, but it quickly turned in favor of the Cardinals when S.Howell's pass intended for J.Dotson was intercepted by Z.Collins. This was due to the pressure exerted by K.Strong. Despite starting in a strong field position following the interception, the Cardinals couldn't capitalize with a touchdown. Instead, they had to settle for a 54-yard field goal by M.Prater, making the score 7-6. When the Commanders got the ball back, they seemed determined to extend their lead. With efficient running by B.Robinson, they managed to move the ball 59 yards in 8 plays. However, the drive concluded with a fumble, leaving the game's momentum up for grabs.

Throughout the first half, both teams showed moments of brilliance but also displayed vulnerabilities. Penalties played a significant role, often changing the course of drives. The narrow 7-6 lead for the Commanders set the stage for an engaging second half.

Q3:
The third quarter began with the Arizona Cardinals already in possession and trailing by a narrow margin. The Cardinals launched a systematic offensive approach that took almost 5 minutes off the clock. Over 11 plays, they moved 56 yards down the field. The drive was punctuated by a series of consistent passes by J. Dobbs, connecting with receivers such as M. Brown, Mi. Wilson, and Z. Ertz. The Cardinals' momentum was somewhat stalled near the red zone, and they had to settle for a 37-yard field goal by M. Prater, putting them ahead 16-10.

In contrast, the Washington Commanders' offense struggled to make a dent. Their first possession of the half resulted in a punt after seven plays yielded zero net yards. Howell, the Commanders' quarterback, was notably sacked, pushing the team into an unfavorable position.

The Cardinals' next possession was similarly stifled, ending in a punt after only four plays. Washington's defensive unit seemed to tighten up, evidenced by D. Payne's fumble recovery after M. Sweat's sack on J. Dobbs, giving the Commanders a prime scoring opportunity as the quarter drew to a close.

Q4:
The fourth quarter started with the Commanders capitalizing on their late third-quarter opportunity. Positioned on the Cardinals' 29-yard line, they mainly relied on their running back, B. Robinson, who consistently chewed up yardage with multiple runs. This ground-and-pound strategy was fruitful, culminating in a touchdown and allowing the Commanders to retake the lead 17-16.

As the quarter progressed, the Cardinals' offense once again failed to gain significant traction. Their first possession of the quarter saw them going backward rather than forward, resulting in a quick three-and-out, forcing them to punt the ball away.

When the Commanders regained possession, they aimed to build on their slender lead. However, their drive didn't last long either. B. Robinson had a mix of positive and negative rushes, and S. Howell's passing didn't yield the necessary first downs. Ultimately, the Commanders also had to punt, but they managed to chew up some crucial time off the clock.

The details provided end at this point, but it's evident that both teams were in a tight contest, with defenses stepping up and offenses struggling to maintain consistent momentum. The Commanders, after trailing for a significant part of the game, managed to come back into the lead in the final quarter.
